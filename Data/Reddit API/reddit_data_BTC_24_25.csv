BTC,2025-02-21,comment,CryptoCurrency,"Comment on: Michael Saylor urges Trump to buy 5M Bitcoin: ""We ...","Good idea. Then the USA can default on its debt, effectively rug pulling the whole world. And USD doesn’t go to zero because it’s backed by Bitcoin. Then Trump can hold another Bretton Woods conference with all the major powers and renegotiate a new agreement wherein all fiat including USD is pegged to Bitcoin. USA doesn’t have to pay back the full amount it borrowed from China or the EU or the Saudis. Instead of in dollars, Trump can pay them back with a very small amount from the Bitcoin reserve which has now skyrocketed in price. Debt solved. The only problem is USD is no longer the world reserve currency and cost of borrowing is much higher, we can’t impose sanctions on anyone anymore, and we can’t run large trade deficits. No more cheap goods from Asia (say bye to Walmart and Dollar General). And no more S&P500 going up forever (global investment in US companies just dries up and shifts to other parts of the world).",41

This represents an 18.51% decrease since his inauguration. The losses are attributed to economic uncertainty from Trump's policies, including a global trade war, and Bitcoin's price struggles, which fell below $80,000 at times. Extensive selling and profit-taking by major investors have also contributed to the decline, signaling a potential bear market for Bitcoin.

Now, should this currency ever be debased or replaced by something else, that would be a loss of soft power the US would not be willing to accept.

The argument is very simple. 

1) Lots of traders brought the highs by pricing in govt buying Bitcoin. Now they are stuck and have to reevaluate their positions. Effectively, they will be future forced sellers. So we have created a new selling pressure for the market.

2) New potential buyers are put off by this notion. With Trump aggressively cutting spending, it is purely bad optics for him to funnel money to buy a speculative macro asset. Ppl are being put off by buying crypto and see this space as another “interest group” to use govt to steal from the poor man to enrich foreign and domestic rich crypto holders. 

This govt using any money, even if budget neutral, further enhances this negative perception and warding off future buyers.

BTC,2025-04-13,post,CryptoCurrency,‘Worse Than 1971’—U.S. Dollar Price ‘Collapse’ Predicted To Ignite $22 Trillion Bitcoin Challenge To Gold,"**U.S. Dollar Crisis and Potential Impact on Bitcoin**

The excerpt discusses a predicted ""dollar confidence crisis"" due to the escalating global trade war led by U.S. President Donald Trump. This crisis is causing the ICE U.S. Dollar Index to plummet, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of the dollar's status as the global reserve currency. As a result, some experts believe that central banks may diversify their reserves, including into bitcoin.

**Key Points:**

* The U.S. dollar is experiencing a ""confidence crisis"" due to the trade war.
* The dollar's decline may lead to a re-evaluation of its status as the global reserve currency.
* Central banks may diversify their reserves, including into bitcoin.
* Bitcoin's price may benefit from the dollar's decline, as it is seen as a safe-haven asset.
* Experts predict that the dollar's decline may lead to a ""de-dollarisation"" process, where countries reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar.",896

BTC,2025-04-13,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: ‘Worse Than 1971’—U.S. Dollar Price ‘Collapse’ Pre...,"tldr; The U.S. dollar is experiencing a significant decline, with analysts comparing the situation to the 1971 removal of the gold standard. This 'confidence crisis' in the dollar is attributed to global trade tensions and could lead to reserve diversification by central banks, including into bitcoin. Bitcoin, often referred to as 'digital gold,' is seen as a potential challenger to gold's $22 trillion market cap. The dollar's fall is boosting other assets, including cryptocurrencies, as traders view bitcoin as a safe haven similar to gold.

Saylor highlights that over 100 public companies hold Bitcoin, and his firm, Strategy, plans to raise $1 billion for further Bitcoin purchases. He remains optimistic despite current prices, citing limited supply and strong institutional interest as key growth drivers.

The bad news, at least for Crypto people hoping the Crypto reserve would be a big thing, is that the crypto reserve will be exclusively made up of seized assets.

So bitcoin per share: 331,200/205.04m = .00161529

Value of .00161529 of a bitcoin at $98k = $158

Cost of share: $395

The cryptocurrency saw a 3% rise in less than a day and is up nearly 10% on the weekly chart, with a market cap of $2.4 trillion. However, analysts warn of a potential short-term pullback due to low trading volume. Ethereum also hit a multi-month high of over $3,000, while other altcoins like HYPE, XRP, and ADA posted gains. The overall crypto market cap rose to $3.71 trillion, with Bitcoin leading the surge.

BTC,2025-07-06,post,CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum Is the Internet of Value | Bitcoin Is Gold, But ETH Is Fueling the Future - DeFi, DAOs, RWAs, L2s and More.","Just crossed with this really interesting Leon [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1941496285506437375)about that Ethereum and Bitcoin can not be compared, something that I have been telling for ages, they are different things.

Ethereum is not just another crypto, it is the backbone of the decentralized future. It is programmable money, the infrastructure for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Layer 2s, Real World Assets (RWAs), stablecoins and a much more.

Furthermore, all the decisions made by Ethereum ecosystem have been made to make Ethereum like it is today and to become what it is going to become. Since the shift to Proof of Stake, ETH is not low energy, yield generating and even deflationary at times with high activity. It is also really usable now with the blobs upgrade that even thought it increased inflation for a while it has drastically reduced gas fees and made Ethereum scalable for when it becomes mainstream and the whole world starts using it, making it again deflationary without no doubt. Holding ETH is like holding a piece of a decentralized Internet.

In the other hand we have Bitcoin, yes, it is the OG and respect to that. It has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it Digital Gold. However it is ""static"". You can't build apps on it like Ethereum. No smart contracts, no ecosystem of dApps, no yield unless you take extra risk elsewhere.

While Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil, fueling a whole economy of innovation, experimentation and value creation.

Thousands of devs are building the future of Ethereum, from zk rollups to real world assets and the platform where this happen is Ethereum. Anyway, both are totally different things with totally different purposes so its a good way to ""diversify"".

We as shrimps dont have to pick sides, we just need to take advantage of opportunities to improve our lives and both are a must in a healthy portfolio.

This comes as Bitcoin and crypto markets have seen substantial growth, partly due to fears of a U.S. dollar collapse. The stimulus, aimed at kickstarting the Chinese economy amid stagnant consumer inflation and fears of a deflationary spiral, could lead to a 'glorious' crypto market bull run. Additionally, there's speculation that China might roll back its 2021 ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining, further fueling market optimism.

FIAT currencies are just losing in value over time due to inflation so it is in your best interest to use the currency as quickly as possible as it will just be worth less in the future.

Any deflationary crypto such as BTC is just much better used as store of value as the value compared to FIAT currencies 'should' go up over time. So why would anyone spend BTC now if there is a good chance it will be worth more in the future. 

That means any crypto working as a FIAT replacement should also be inflationary to incentivize people to spend it quickly.

If we ever get to a time where most of the things we use/need in the world get cheaper rather than more expensive (maybe AI etc) then we may have to rethink inflationary vs deflationary cryptos but this may not happen for a while if ever as we have limited resources. Although at some point some companies might be able to mine asteroids etc and we can get more resources but that's far in the future.",3

Last year it was because they were close to ""a perfect landing"". But now it is because there has been, so far, a a very mild slowing of the economy paired with a small uptick in inflation. With forces pulling in two directions in terms of monetary policy it is better to sit their hands and wait for clarity. 

The popular consensus is that they are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. That is to say that the Fed thinks stagflation is a real possibility. If that is the case then the playbook is to deal with inflation first (tightening monetary policy, raising interest rates) and only afterwards dealing with employment.

Binance experienced the most liquidations, followed by OKX and Bybit. After peaking at $93,400, Bitcoin corrected to $92,462, marking a 5.5% increase in 24 hours and 24% over the week. Analysts predict Bitcoin could exceed $100,000, with some forecasting a rise to $130,000. Notably, Robert Kiyosaki plans to accumulate Bitcoin until it reaches $100,000, while Arthur Hayes suggests potential for BTC to hit $1 million under certain economic policies.

Gold has also set its precedent for value over literally the entire course of human history. The only advantage BTC has in my mind is that its a lot easier to possess and trade than gold, which is a quality definitely worth something. But to be honest, all the hype and press around it right now makes me believe more than ever the market is about to get suplexed.

BTC,2024-11-27,post,CryptoCurrency,Just a dumb question: Will MicroStrategy be forced to sell their BTC if it goes well below their average purchase price (around 56k at present),"Today I checked the [MSTR Tracker](https://www.mstr-tracker.com)  and just realized that the average purchase price of BTC of MicroStrategy has increased significantly to approx. 56k. This is actually quite a significant value while the whole ""business model"" of MSTR is to use leverage (through selling debt and diluting their shares) to buy and pop-up BTC's value.  
So I just have quite a dumb question: will MSTR be forced to sell their BTC if it goes well below this average purchase price? I asked this question because, at this scale, even with this idea (of them being forced selling their huge stack of BTC to the market) is already highly concerned to say the least.  
Thanks.

BTC,2024-11-27,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Just a dumb question: Will MicroStrategy be forced...,"I research on this. This time is not the same as last time.   
  
MSTR got close to been forced to sell in the last cycle because they had BTC as collateral to protect their loans, so if BTC dipped too low, they would have been forced to either sell BTC or add more collateral to cover the debt.

Fast forward to today, they were able to pay that loan back in November and took a new loan, but without BTC as collateral, instead they offered shares of MSTR as collateral. The debt is structured more like an option, where the issuer can convert into MSTR at a fix price in 2028. If the price of BTC goes really low, the debt will be redeemed in stocks, and thus they won't be 'forced' to sell or be liquidated.

It's hard to explain in simple terms, but the tldr; is that they won't risk being liquidated and having to sell their BTC this time around.",17

1. MSTR issues almost 0% convertible senior note debt. There’s no collateral there as it was back in 2022. There’s no margin call or liquidation event. You cannot “call” this debt, that’s not how it works. 

Sources: Saylor himself. https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxAN88Zn8X7VqAMJmJCusWbVpyPwAMADsI?si=_Nz1jU7rVNn0mbeD

2. In 2022 the debt required collateral of 50%. In case of MSTR it was around $3,000 per BTC. The 22K floating around the comments, 30K and etc is wrong. BTC dipped to 15k, do you remember any liquidation?

BTC,2025-06-18,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Bitcoin ‘going to take over’—Elon Musk backs shock...,"tldr; Elon Musk has supported Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's warning that Bitcoin could replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency if Congress fails to address the growing national debt, projected to reach $40 trillion. Musk criticized excessive government spending and its impact on the deficit, warning of unsustainable debt burdens. Bitcoin's price surge and its adoption by companies as a treasury asset highlight its potential as a safe haven amid concerns over dollar devaluation and inflation.

Analysts suggest that significant profit-taking may not occur until Bitcoin hits $130,900, based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric. A $4.4 billion rise in Bitcoin's realized cap indicates strong investment activity rather than speculative trading. Some analysts predict further price increases, with targets as high as $150,000, supported by bullish market patterns and investor confidence.

Hayes forecasts a bitcoin price of $250,000 by year-end, citing parallels to the post-Covid stimulus-driven price boom. The Fed's upcoming decisions are seen as pivotal for market direction.

He argues that while gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against economic downturns, it is impractical due to its physical nature. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is portable, easier to transact with, and can be fractionalized, making it a more valuable asset. Cuban suggests that bitcoin's potential to function as both a store of value and a currency gives it an edge over gold.

Unfortunately, I have to go to x/twitter to get the latest dialogue for what is happening in blockchain.  This sector is infested with people (mostly men) who are some of the biggest fucking losers I have ever seen.

And yeah, I get it man, you got 7 figures in your phantom wallet.  You got a nice house, you got a big dick, you fuck beautiful women.  I get it guys, ""YOU WON"".  But you know what else?  You are the biggest losers I have ever seen.

These guys can't stop talking about sucking trumps dick, fondling elons balls.  Man - what in the fuck happened to this space?  This isn't what we were looking forward to the last cycle.  Whatever *this is* is some sick, twisted nightmare of what we all thought decentralization could be.  This isn't what I signed up for and I am definitely not down for this sick, twisted, fascist shit.

I hate what has happened to this space and I hate the type of people it attracts.  It was always there, but now it is entirely too emboldened.  It's too bad there is a silver lining of something good somewhere wayyyyyyy underneath.  I honestly hope Satoshi is still alive, and when the US government makes the biggest gamble in history on BTC, I hope he rugs the entire thing and sends that disaster leadership to the end of a terrible regime.

Sorry guys for the vent, but this space is full of toxic, loser, parasites and it only seems like it will get worse.

EDIT:  Just wanted to clarify, I was NOT targeting this sub, I am talking about X/Twitter.  However, I will say that the types of people this cycle is bringing in is definitely not exclusive to X/Twitter, it is happening anywhere and everywhere in this industry.  It just so happens that X/Twitter is the place their rhetoric is most emboldened and made into dogma.",9250

It is the ***Darwinian effect*** of crypto's inability to find good use cases and its overreliance on unsustainable economic models.

1. Many normal people got liquidated hard on NFT investments and DeFi ponzis from the last cycle.
2. Then you have a massive graveyard of alt L1s running on inflation/VC money to keep lights on and have no path to real adoption.

When ""long-term"" investments don't pay out, you get the social to search for short-term opportunities, regardless of future consequences.

When the winners are short-term focused, you start to see a consolidation of capital and power influence among those who look for quick gains at all costs.

This rise has fueled speculation about Bitcoin reaching $100,000, driven by significant purchases from companies like MicroStrategy. The surge has also resulted in substantial liquidations in the market.

BTC,2025-03-14,post,CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin right now: Different price, Same guarantees.","I've been in the Bitcoin world since 2016.

Over those years, I've seen the price of Bitcoin plummet, and soar, I don't know how many times.

Each time, those who don't understand why Bitcoin exists panic.

They lose faith in the Bitcoin revolution because they haven't bought for the right reasons, or because they haven't studied Bitcoin enough to develop the strength of conviction needed in this unique revolution.

There's nothing extraordinary about seeing the price of Bitcoin fall from $109K to $77K. It's entirely logical and to be expected.

The price of Bitcoin could fall even further. It won't change my view of Bitcoin as long as the fundamentals of the Bitcoin revolution are still there. And they are still there.

With Bitcoin, the price is different right now, but the guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol are the same:

* There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
* 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
* An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
* A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
* A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
* Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
* A permanently available network (Uptime > 99.989% since Bitcoin creation)
* A never-hacked network
* The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable
* The Bitcoin code is open-source

1st bought in in 2013. Narrative which got me in,was digital money (not asset),anonymity,finite supply,low fees,me in control of my bitcoins.

In short I imagined having btc on my phone,topping up from a cold wallet once in a while, paying everywhere to everyone instantly. Basically thinking in bitcoins.. Not in dollars. While keeping anonymity. 

Reality check after 12 years. Noone uses BTC for payments. Digital gold because of finite supply? Cmon,I can buy Berkshire shares or SP500. Anonymity? 0 if you KYC somewhere. All in all what is left is me being in control. Not the bank,not the government.. But still the only way how to get something is to cash in to fiat via some institution. 

It only increases in value? Depends when you bought in. If you bought in 2017 in the peak for 19k,you are up 4x in 8 years.. If 109k was the top   this time and you bought in for 50k in 2021,was it really worth it? Yes,there can be opposite,that got in for superb price,but point being - as for the returns magnitude, there starts to be more and more competition in other markets.

In a world with a sound money, a non-money SoV is superfluous as money itself becomes the optimal SoV and non-money SoVs add only transaction costs - and in this case, adding the negative of significant transaction cost without even any intrinsic value.

So the whole project is currently stuck in this oxymoronic spot while other cryptos have surpassed its ability to fulfill the original mission.

What remains is merely raw speculation based on perceived first-mover advantage.  Eventually the market will discover that Bitcoin (the BTC version) is no longer actually moving toward the goal of becoming a money, and then start evaluating it based on…

BTC,2025-05-06,comment,CryptoCurrency,"Comment on: Never sell your Bitcoin, maxis say. Then why are t...","Not a Bitcoin maxi, but:

If you have a bunch of a high value asset (e.g. $1 billion in Bitcoin or gold or Amazon stock), that asset is extremely useful even if you have no intention to ever sell it. The reason for this is loan collateralization, which is a big part of how the rich get richer and avoid taxes. That billion in assets lets you get loans at extremely low interest rates. You can then take out new loans to cover your old loans, and this is fine because you have so much collateral that your debt to asset ratio is never in question.

When you die, your estate can then sell some of your assets to cover outstanding loan balances. When done this way as part of inheritance, you manage to avoid getting taxed for gains on the assets that were sold. This is a big part of how generational wealth works.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Bitcoin prices are unsustainably high after surging 89-fold in a year and that the virtual money isn’t currency.

“It’s a bubble,” Greenspan, 87, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from Washington. “It has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven’t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.”

BTC,2024-11-28,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $250K–...,"EDIT: HEADLINE PULLED OUT OF ASS! I've watched the whoe 18 min video, there is absolutely zaero predictions of 250K-500K bitcoin! (if anyone has actual source please link). So I was right with my skepticism (read below) as price predictions are totally unlike what Hosk talks abouts. However, the things he actually said there are way more exciting. He talks about implementing Minotaur with BITCOIN! OMG I've expected they iwll make their own PoW or merge with Ergo or something. But comboining Cardano's PoS security with BITCOIN's PoW security? That's soooo exciting, beyond my expectations. He also talked about implementing Bitcoin into CArdano's Lace wallet, where you could naturally and easily bridge the ecosystems, and allow DeFi on bitcoin! He also said the awesome overcryptocollaterialzed stablecoin DJED will also get Bitcoin collateral. That's also amazing!

Now my initial reaction after I just read the headline, before watching his speech:

Seriously? Common man, I love Cardano, and when Charles makes these educational technical blackboard vides, and sometimes some funny AMAs. On the other hands I'm not too much into his right-wing political rants, but predicting moons feels quite unlike him, did he really say that? I'mn gonna watch that speech to fact check what's it about, and in 10 minutes I'll edit what I actually head there. Becaume right now I've always seen him not caring about price predictions, he always says price goes up down and it has no effect on the actual tech, he of course celebrates when the price hits some nice high, but moon prediction? Well, I'm listening right now to see for myself if he really seriouly gonna say that there. Right now I kinda expect him to just jokingly say hey it might go to 250K or 500K or down, we dont know. I've never seen him seriously make price predictions and I listen to him a lot, so I'll see, listening right now, 14 minutes left.",21

This forecast is driven by increasing institutional investment and the potential growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, which could enhance its utility. Hoskinson views Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for governments and institutions, akin to gold. The crypto market has reacted positively to this prediction, with Bitcoin experiencing significant price fluctuations, and analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its long-term prospects.

Saylor reiterated that Bitcoin's value should be viewed in BTC terms, not USD. Critics have previously called his investment advice, including leveraging assets like homes, irresponsible. MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, has significant debt and many of its Bitcoin purchases are currently at a loss, with an average cost basis of $67,458 per BTC.

The initiative aims to prevent further premature sales and explore budget-neutral strategies to accumulate more bitcoin.

Analysts predict Bitcoin may break its all-time high of $110,000 within 1–2 weeks, mirroring recent breakouts in gold and the S&P 500. The digital asset market has added $190 billion in value amid optimism over easing trade tensions and strong economic data.

This move is anticipated to potentially boost the bitcoin and crypto market, with expectations of a 'glorious' China-America crypto bull market. The decision comes as the global financial community watches the Federal Reserve for signs of interest rate cuts, which could also impact the crypto market. Bitcoin's price has been fluctuating, with recent trades showing stability around the $60,000 mark, indicating a solid support base for future growth.

BTC,2024-08-23,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Forget The Fed—China Could Be About To Drop A $420...,"I think everyone is missing the point of the article.
This article isn't specifically stating crypto is being made legal in China or that the yuan has to directly be put into BTC. It's basically saying the PBOC (People's Bank Of China) is now able to initiate their own QE with a weaker US dollar in play without destroying their own economy. The central banks have been coordinating this for a while. They must refinance the global debt with lower rates and by printing easy money. The bill is coming due in 2025 and they don't want to refinance with high rates. 

With global markets as intricately connected as they are with US bond purchases, reverse repos, etc, this PBOC global liquidity increase will pour out globally. Global liquidity is intricately correlated with BTC price and I would argue is the most important macro indicator for BTC price action that there is (well actually because Lyn Alden says this).

BTC,2025-03-10,post,CryptoCurrency,"Bull Cycle Climax Ahead? BTC Dominance Topping Out, ETH at a Macro Low, and Altseason Starting April 2025","I think we’re setting up for the final act of this bull cycle, a critical phase where the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market undergo a significant shift. This setup is characterized by the ETH/BTC ratio appearing to approach a bottom, signaling that Ethereum might be undervalued relative to Bitcoin, a pattern often seen before major altcoin rallies. Simultaneously, Bitcoin dominance is approaching a topping point, currently hovering around 60-61% as of March 9, 2025, which mirrors the high levels seen in late 2020. Meanwhile, Ethereum is starting to find a macro low, with its price potentially stabilizing around $4,000-$4,100, a level where over $5 billion in short liquidations are reportedly sitting. These liquidations could act as a catalyst, triggering a sharp upward move if market sentiment shifts. This scenario is assuming we follow a similar pattern to the last cycle, where late-stage bull run dynamics paved the way for an altcoin surge.

Looking back, Bitcoin dominance peaked around December 28, 2020 (or very close to it, at approximately 70%), a pivotal moment in the previous cycle. This peak marked the beginning of a gradual decline, as capital began to rotate away from Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. This subsequent decline was the starting point for the 2021 altseason, which gained steam in January as Ethereum and other altcoins started to outperform Bitcoin. The altseason reached its peak in the spring, particularly around May 2021, when smaller-cap coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw explosive gains. December 28, 2020, was a turning point where Bitcoin’s grip on market dominance loosened, setting the stage for altcoins to shine brightly in the months that followed. This historical precedent suggests that a similar dominance peak now could herald another significant altcoin rally.

This would theoretically be the setup we are witnessing now—the start of an altseason approaching, a phenomenon typically observed only in the later stages of a crypto bull run. The current market conditions, with Bitcoin dominance nearing its zenith and Ethereum poised for a potential reversal, echo the late 2020 transition. An altseason doesn’t emerge until Bitcoin’s initial post-halving surge matures, allowing speculative capital to flow into altcoins. Based on this pattern, the altseason likely begins between April and June 2025, as Bitcoin dominance is expected to drop from its current 60-61% to perhaps 50-55%, a decline of 5-10%, which historically triggers altcoin momentum. During this period, Ethereum could rally from its macro low of $4,000-$4,100 toward $5,000 or higher, driven by the liquidation squeeze and renewed investor interest. Other altcoins, tracked via TOTAL3 (the market cap excluding BTC and ETH), might see similar gains, potentially doubling from current levels as seen in past cycles.

The BTC top, following this altseason, is projected to occur between August and November 2025, with a lean toward October-November due to summer’s low liquidity. This timeline fits the 4-year cycle’s 17-18 month peak window from the April 19, 2024, halving, aligning with the 18-month lag observed in 2021. Summer months (June-August) often bring reduced trading volume and liquidity, as traders and institutions take vacations, leading to consolidation rather than a parabolic move. This could delay the final BTC surge until fall, when market participation typically rebounds. Historically, Bitcoin has continued to rise alongside altcoins for a few months after the altseason peak (e.g., May 2021 to November 2021), suggesting that after an altcoin-driven summer, BTC could hit $105,000-$120,000 in a final blow-off top. This projection assumes a 30-50% increase from its current $80,529 (March 9, 2025), consistent with past cycle tops.

The interplay between these factors—dominance peaking, ETH/BTC bottoming, and the macro low—sets the stage for a dramatic finale to this bull cycle. If we follow the 2020-2021 pattern, the next few months will be crucial, with April-June 2025 marking the altseason’s onset and October-November 2025 potentially delivering the cycle’s climax. Monitoring dominance trends, ETH’s breakout, and liquidity shifts will be key to confirming this trajectory. This late-stage setup underscores the cyclical nature of crypto markets, where Bitcoin’s dominance gives way to altcoin dominance before the ultimate peak.

Also the stock market is very slow, the damage of 2008 wasn't seen on charts until 2009. The way crypto dumped before stocks started going down means companies are selling crypto holdings to cover stock losses. Crypto will die first, companies next, then hopefully crypto goes up.

The company aims to use Bitcoin as a corporate asset and hedge against inflation, while also planning to grow its mining operations and explore strategic acquisitions. The rising Bitcoin price and institutional interest are driving this strategy.

VanEck's analysis considers global trade, GDP growth, and Bitcoin’s monetary velocity.

BTC,2024-11-19,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Bitcoin metric breakout teases 'inevitable' 90% BT...,"tldr; Bitcoin may experience a significant price rally if the Puell Multiple, a key BTC price metric, repeats its historical breakout pattern. According to CryptoQuant, the Puell Multiple has crossed its 365-day moving average only three times in the past five years, each time resulting in substantial BTC price surges. Historically, this has led to an average price increase of around 90%. The metric, which assesses miner stability, suggests that favorable macroeconomic conditions could lead to an ""inevitable"" strong bull rally for Bitcoin.

Predictions from prominent figures like Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey suggest Bitcoin could reach $1 million or more in the long term, driven by its fixed supply and increasing adoption.

This seems like she believes treasuries are definitely cooked and we’re supposed to get out ahead of it. So…buy bitcoin and have a new reserve.

This shift comes as the bitcoin price nears $100,000, driven by Donald Trump's presidential victory and expectations of relaxed U.S. crypto regulations. Trump's administration, featuring pro-crypto advisors, may further boost bitcoin's appeal as a strategic asset.

Trump has also promised to stop selling seized Bitcoin, fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and support the use of digital assets. These developments have contributed to the surge in Bitcoin's value.

This spike followed MicroStrategy's announcement of purchasing an additional 1,070 BTC. The move disrupted significant sell orders at the $100,000 mark, leading to $36 million in BTC short liquidations. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin needs to close above $101,000 to enter price discovery, with potential to reach $103,000. The market awaits macroeconomic influences, including the upcoming US jobs report.

BTC,2025-06-16,post,CryptoCurrency,"Right now, BTC is caught between FOMO and fear. The market is bullish — but the world isn’t exactly stable.","On one hand, we’ve got solid bullish signals:  
• SharpLink Gaming just bought $463 million worth of ETH, becoming the largest public ETH holder.  
• Anthony Pompliano is reportedly raising $750 million via a SPAC to buy Bitcoin. Yes, *that* Pompliano — the one who was calling for $500K BTC during the bear market.  
• BTC hit $110,000 last Tuesday — almost breaking its ATH of $111,940 from May 22.

— On the other hand, the macro picture isn't so pretty:  
• Israeli airstrikes on Iran sent BTC down 2.8% in 90 minutes. They can crash BTC at any moment, all it takes is another hit.  
• Last time, $427 million in long positions got wiped out. Bulls took a hit, fast.

# So, can BTC still reach $119,000 in this climate?

Personally, I’m cautiously optimistic.

✓ The fundamentals are strong: institutional adoption, post-halving supply tightening, growing ETF demand, and now SPACs targeting BTC.  
✗ But short-term moves are still dictated by geopolitics. And that’s not something even the whales can control.

So yes, $119K is possible — but timing it depends more on global stability than TA.

# What about Ethereum?

ETH is quietly building up momentum too:  
• SharpLink staked over 95% of its ETH — that’s a long-term move, not just speculation.  
• If this continues, a return to $4,000 feels realistic. Not immediate, but definitely in sight — especially if the SEC eases up.

What do you think?  
• Can BTC still hit $119K this year?  
• Are we underestimating the impact of war and instability?  
• Should ETH be getting more attention right now?

The volumes look ""low"" relative to the trade boom at the end of May - that's why I'm still waiting for the decline.

BUT: as you say, the movement is slowly but steadily crawling upwards. I won't attempt a psychological analysis of BTC market because that will end only in schizophrenia. The amount of scalping bots is ludicrous. 

I was expecting a dropdown to $97k establishing a ""baseline"" - past years we've also seen larger drops after these ""hype rallies"", so even $70k seemed realistic to me (but no further than that) - before the inevitable Winter rally that will send BTC to $200k lol

Global situation has been so unstable - but I think that provides ""stability"" to alternative currencies like BTC & ETH (although is still fucky): people expect doom of FIAT, so they turn to alternatives.

Long-term man, who tf knows honestly. It seems like an inevitability that BTC will rise to $200k - I didn't believe in $100k 2 years ago and here we are.. It's just hard to fathom the long-term trajectory of BTC and what it's place in our future world will be - digital asset that somehow resembles an S&P500 of crypto, or gold, or a form of digital currency (which it always was intended to be).",5

However, skepticism exists, with some questioning the practicality of this move unless the US faces a major economic challenge. Market predictions show only a 25% likelihood of this policy being introduced by President-elect Trump.

This shift indicates growing U.S. investor interest. XRP's price has surged over 600% since November 2024, reaching $3.33. The increase in trading volume and price is attributed to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's meeting with President-elect Trump and speculation about a potential XRP ETF approval in the U.S. The number of large XRP holders has also reached a new record, reflecting strong institutional participation.

Favorable U.S. financial conditions, including a shift to ultra-loose liquidity, have supported Bitcoin's bullish momentum. However, on-chain indicators like the Supply in Profit Market Bands and Advanced Net UTXO Supply Ratio suggest the market is entering overheated territory, historically linked to price corrections or consolidations. While momentum remains strong, caution is advised due to increased volatility and profit-taking risks.

The price recently dropped below $100,000 due to global trade war concerns following new tariffs by the US and China. Analysts suggest that maintaining a weekly close above $93,000 is crucial to avoid further downside volatility. Trade tensions could increase economic uncertainty, impacting Bitcoin's price, but may also drive demand for alternatives to the US dollar.

And furthermore, what if BTC goes to 150k-200k but the alts see a much much smaller movement.   
Typically BTC leads and alts follow, this year all I can see is that BTC leads (massively so) and alts don't do much of anything, with the exclusion of some short term meme coins. Do we already have enough information to speculate that this year's bull run, if any, will be dedicated solely to BTC (and perhaps ETH) ? 

So many of us, waiting to 3x, 5x etc so we can finally quit these casino coins and wait calmly for the next bear cycle. However, it seems that we're not even given a chance to escape from them.

The bitcoin maxi narrative focuses on leading you to believe everything will fall to the awesome utility of bitcoin in time, but- that’s now really how tech works. 

It has to be useable or it will fail (it has to be easy for the average consumer to use), it has to continue to develop or it will become archaic, and most of all whatever resources power it (miners) have to be supported rather than drained. 

So- is it the most used? Is it developing ways to be more user friendly? Is it profitable for its miners? 

Unfortunately being a Bitcoin maxi has had a devastating impact on growth and learning from other developers. They lost help from the group that had basically even doing all the work for them as their test chain, and there were too many ideas without direction amongst the developers to get anything done.

The miners started going bankrupt this bear market, decreasing network security, And Bitcoin lost a market share of being the number 1 used to the group that had been their test chain and doing all the work.

Official Trump ($TRUMP) is a fungible cryptocurrency asset created on the Solana blockchain. It serves as a digital representation of support for the ideals and beliefs symbolised by the ""$TRUMP"" token and associated artwork. According to its creators, it is not intended to function as an investment vehicle, investment contract, or security. The token’s branding draws inspiration from former U.S. President Donald J.

The cryptocurrency recently hit a new all-time high of over $108,000 before pulling back to around $95,000 due to profit-taking by mid-term holders. This behavior is similar to past bull markets, where profit-taking led to a phase of exhaustion. For Bitcoin to maintain its upward momentum, increased demand and new buyers are crucial. The current market sentiment suggests potential rallies above $100,000 if support levels are maintained and demand continues to grow.

BTC,2024-07-16,post,CryptoCurrency,Why BTC will keep going up as long as people keep predicting a crash ,"The last time BTC had an exponential move to the upside was during the last election year. This is partially because the halvening cycle and the election cycle are currently in sync every 4 years, but there’s further reasons as to why we’ll likely see much higher prices sooner rather than later. 

1.) We’ve obviously been in a 5 month range. Usually, a long time of price consolidation, results in a massive move. Any move above the 70ks will be swift and large 

2.) The ETH ETF approval is coming up thus further legitimizing crypto in general and allowing for even more people to easily invest 

3.) Given the largely negative sentiment merely two weeks ago, there are still tons of shorts trapped. The funding rates for most derivative contracts on BTC are still very low indicating that the overall futures market is not very bullish yet despite a 10% move. This almost always indicates further upside 

4.) Most of the chatter online is expecting a long boring summer and fall. BTC loves to go up after long periods of boredom and when people least expect it

But last, and most importantly, just look around you even on this sub. You’ll see comments along the lines of:

“Sounds like you’re coping and bought the top”
“Let’s be real this is going back to the 40ks”
“BTC is a dead asset”
“If you seriously think 60+k is a good price to buy BTC, you’re deluded” 

Most of this sub was calling for 40ks just two weeks ago. See you in the 80s.

Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, has made several notable forecasts that have been widely criticized for their inaccuracy. Here are some of the most prominent examples:

# 1. Global Recession Under Trump

In 2016, Krugman predicted that the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States would lead to a global recession. He expressed this view in an opinion piece for The New York Times, warning that Trump's policies and leadership would undo years of economic progress since the financial crisis. This prediction did not materialize, as the global economy did not enter a recession during Trump's presidency.

# 2. The Euro's Imminent Collapse

Between 2010 and 2012, Krugman repeatedly predicted the imminent collapse of the euro. He suggested that the eurozone's monetary union was fundamentally flawed and that the euro could fall apart with stunning speed. Despite these warnings, the euro has remained intact, and the eurozone has not experienced the catastrophic breakup Krugman forecasted.

# 3. The Impact of the Sequester

Krugman described the 2013 U.S. federal budget sequester as ""one of the worst policy ideas in our nation's history,"" predicting it would cause significant economic damage and cost around 700,000 jobs. However, the U.S. economy continued to grow, and the feared negative impacts did not materialize to the extent he predicted.

# 4. Internet's Limited Impact

In 1998, Krugman predicted that the growth of the Internet would slow drastically and that its impact on the economy would be no greater than that of the fax machine. This prediction has been proven wrong, as the Internet has become a central component of the global economy and has revolutionized numerous industries.

# 5. Recession in 2019 or 2020

In early 2019, Krugman warned of a possible global recession occurring in late 2019 or early 2020, citing various economic headwinds and the potential ineffectiveness of Trump's tax cut stimulus. While the global economy did face challenges, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the specific timing and causes of the downturn differed from Krugman's forecast.",9

In fact, when the first ASIC miners were coming out, people freaked out that a handful of people (especially the ASIC companies) could have the power to compromise Bitcoin network.

They’ve opened a staggering $123 million LONG position on ETH and a $72 million LONG on BTC—both with an eye-watering 50X leverage! 
This trade could be seen and found on Hyperliquid platform.

 Funny how this lucky whale was able to time this trade perfectly just right before the US president announced the U.S crypto reserve strategy, and it's goals to become the Crypto Capital of the World. Just being 2% down would have liquidated his position.
Yet he is now up hundreds of millions from this incredible trade and luck!

BTC,2025-06-14,post,CryptoCurrency,Crypto is now officially boring,"I don’t care what anyone says, crypto is boring now.

Bitcoin is just slowly going up. That’s obviously better than it going down, and long term it’s good, but it’s not exciting to watch. There’s no real action. Just a gradual increase that doesn’t really get people talking. It used to be unpredictable. Now it just feels like a slightly more volatile stock market. It’s not even moving much day to day. It’s kind of the same pattern every week. Up a bit, down a bit, repeat.

And everything else in the space feels the same. All the altcoins and shitcoins just feel like copies of each other. There’s nothing new. Nothing interesting. Just the same old people trying to hype projects that don’t go anywhere. You scroll through crypto Twitter or Reddit and it’s just recycled takes, recycled memes, and everyone hoping the next pump will come soon. There’s no buzz like there used to be.

It used to be chaotic, but that was kind of the fun part. You never knew what was coming next. Some random coin could shoot up 1,000% in a week and be everywhere. People were arguing, speculating, trying new things. It had energy. Now it just feels quiet. The markets are mostly flat, interest is lower, and even when something new launches, no one really seems to care.

NFTs had their moment and then died off fast. Most of the platforms are empty now. DeFi doesn’t feel like it’s moving either. A lot of the Layer 2 stuff seems interesting on paper but I don’t really see many people using it outside of a few hardcore users. Even when projects do something new, it feels like no one’s watching. Engagement is low and it’s hard to tell who actually cares anymore. Most people are probably just holding and waiting.

I’m not saying crypto is going away or that it doesn’t have a future. The tech is still progressing, and I’m sure there will be another wave at some point. But right now it just feels stuck. There’s not much to talk about that hasn’t already been said. There’s not much happening that hasn’t already happened before. People seem bored, or tired, or just waiting for someone else to make the next move.

Maybe this is what happens when things get more mainstream. Maybe it’s just a quiet phase before something big. But it’s hard to stay interested when everything feels so flat.

Crypto used to feel like something you had to keep up with every day or you’d miss something crazy. Now you can check in once a week and you’re still caught up. That says it all really.

For now, it’s just boring. Hopefully that changes. But right now, that’s the truth.

But, the rest of the crypto market is still volatile as ever. Have you seen Dogecoin (#8 in marketcap) from April low to May high? 100% move. Then down 35% since then. And, down 65% from Dec. high. ETH, ADA, SOL, etc. all similar story.

I don't blame this solely on decrease in Bitcoin volatility over the years. It's just.. everything else has been a lot more volatile. Stocks, even gold, real estate from Covid lows.. have seen increase in volatility. And, I think people have normalized it.

Bitcoin's done 2700% from Covid low, with $2.1tn market cap. NVDA has done 3280% from Covid low, with $3.5tn market cap now.

Granted, NVDA is a crazy volatility even for a stock. Bitcoin used to be the king in volatility.. not so much anymore. You have to go down to lower market cap to find more volatility, which is still there, imo.",7

Data shows Bitcoin's average and median monthly returns in September are negative, making it one of the worst months for cryptocurrency investors. Despite this trend, there have been exceptions with Bitcoin experiencing gains in September of some years. The article suggests that while historical patterns indicate a potential for losses, the market could still surprise investors. Current Bitcoin trading trends and analyst predictions are mixed, with some expecting short-term bearish trends but remaining optimistic in the long term. Investors are advised to proceed with caution and monitor the market closely.

Analysts noted Bitcoin's fixed supply and structural demand as key factors in its stability.

BTC,2025-07-09,post,CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin treasuries are insanely bullish. Bitcoin could challenge $500K this cycle.,"Once BTC breaks around $145K, we’ll hit all-time highs not just in USD, but also in EUR, CHF, GBP, etc.

My points:

1) A few billion in inflows from Treasuries or corporate cash reserves is tiny compared to the total fiat parked in low-yield assets.

2) MicroStrategy is obviously the biggest buyer but who's next? Apple? Meta? Tesla doubling down? Even a few percent of S&P 500 treasury cash moving into BTC (we’re talking tens of billions) could slingshot Bitcoin to $500K+.

3) BTC market cap right now  aprox $1.3T. A $100B inflow (a rounding error of global institutional wealth) could double the price due to low float and hodl hodl chants.

Once we cross ATHs in all major fiat currencies, escape velocity kicks in.

Out of 40,000+ coins analyzed over the past 10 years, only 1.7% delivered a 100x return!","Here’s the hard truth about investing:

*You always hear about the guy who made $100K by betting $100. You never hear about those who put in thousands and are left with nothing.*

All of us have at least once wished we had made a similar play to the one that [turned $17 into \~6M](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m)[.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) More than 2.1 million people right now are trying to find the next crypto moonshot. Even the CEO of Coinbase is touting how if someone had bought $100 Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded, it would be worth $1.5 million today.

With all that’s going on, what’s the actual probability of getting a 100x return on your investment in the crypto world?

# What are the odds that you will lose 100% of your investment?

Of the more than 40,000 coins that traded in an exchange at least once in the last 10 years, only 38% are still alive. So forget about making a profit — the probability that the coin you buy will survive over the long run is only \~ 1 in 3.

[Total number of coins: 40,399 | Source: Market Sentiment Research, CoinGecko](https://preview.redd.it/3den43lgi66e1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13079314237019897f6099b094b53cc56c4425d)

# What about 100’xing your investment?

While there are probably hundreds *(even thousands)* of coins that might have 100’xed in value during their brief existence *(like the Hawk Tuah coin)*, it’s unrealistic to expect to find them and invest in them before someone rug pulls them out of existence.

To get a more realistic scenario, we kept a minimum market cap limit of $10 Million and required the coin to be present in the top 100 coins based on market cap.

The backtest is simple — At the beginning of every month *(starting in 2014)*, we check what the top 100 most popular coins were and the probability that you would have 100’xed your investment if you held on to that coin *(*[data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-3jqju58bfewDd2GxfH0jd0woO2kSKYEodFYkf6JB0/edit?usp=sharing)*).*

In the last 10 years, there were a total of 9,502 coins that fit our criteria. Out of these, only 442 *(4.6%)* grew more than 100x. This assumes that you sold at the very top. If you had held on to these coins to date, the number drops to 160.

**So, over the holding period, the chance that you 100’xed your investment on a coin is only 1.7%.**

If you remove the duplicates *(as the same coin can come up in our filter in different months),* of the 460 cryptocurrencies that made it into the list, only 38 *(8%)* grew more than 100x. If you held on till 2024, only 8 coins *(1.7%)* provided you with a 100x return.

>

If you are calculating the expected value and think that you will come out ahead *(given you have a \~2% chance of 100x returns)*, you must read [our research on Kelly Criterion.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/the-problem-with-averages)

For those who are determined to try to win, here are a few things to consider:

1. **Be aware of the odds** — The chance of you hitting a 100x return on your meme coin investment is less than 1 in 50. To put this in perspective, it’s like picking a specific card out of a shuffled deck of cards on your first try!
2. **Spread your bets —** The best way to improve your odds of winning is to survive. You can reduce your risk and improve your returns by [diversifying and making smart bet sizes.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/shannons-demon)",2514

I also did one of the most comprehensive report on building a DCA strategy for Crypto: 

* $100 invested monthly into the top-10 cryptocurrencies starting in 2014 would have grown to $650K+ by 2018 and an incredible $1.6M+ by 2021.
* The top-10 portfolio had a CAGR of 111% *(yeah, not a typo)* over the last 10 years - And irrespective of the year you started, you beat S&P 500!
* Even with all this, the Bitcoin-only portfolio gave a better risk adjusted return.

It's not an exaggeration to consider that aggressive trade wars could shock the global supply chain as much as covid and force a deep recession. Even if it's ""temporary pain"" as Trump says, it could take 6-12 months to work itself out. Just in time for crypto-winter.

Bitwise also notes that the U.S.'s growing fiscal debt and potential dollar debasement could further drive Bitcoin's appeal. The analysis suggests Bitcoin's increasing scarcity could push its value toward $200,000 by year-end.

BTC,2024-12-15,post,Bitcoin,Why Michael Saylor/MSTR Is Essentially Funneling Endless Money Into Bitcoin Pricing,"Hello friends of r/Bitcoin!

I am taking the liberty of sharing this post, originally posted on the r/MSTR sub, as I think many of you might not realise this.

Today, I'd like to discuss/shed light on an angle of MicroStrategy that I think **almost everyone is overlooking**.

I've been following MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its Bitcoin strategy for a long while now, and it’s striking how many investors only scratch the surface. Most people look at MSTR’s play and think, “They’re just leveraging up to buy Bitcoin, hoping it appreciates.” But what’s actually happening under the hood involves a much deeper interplay of bond markets, repo markets, and broker-dealer dynamics that the average investor simply isn’t aware of.

**The Bond/Repo/Broker Dealer Triangle**  
At the core, you have a system where bond creation and leverage are integral to how capital is formed and deployed. When MSTR issues debt (often convertible notes) to finance Bitcoin purchases, they’re effectively tapping into a part of the financial system that can summon liquidity out of thin air. Broker dealers often provide financing for these bonds, using them as collateral, which allows enormous amounts of capital to move into digital assets without traditional hurdles.

Here’s a simplified version of what happens:

1. **MSTR issues bonds** – These aren’t ordinary loans. They can be convertible notes or other structured products, which the market eagerly snaps up.
2. **Broker dealers and repo markets come into play** – Once the bonds hit the secondary markets, broker dealers can pledge them as collateral in the repo market, effectively multiplying the money supply and tapping into a well of liquidity. This isn’t “new” in finance; it’s how a significant part of the global capital market operates. But applying this mechanism to fund Bitcoin purchases is still relatively novel.
3. **No Direct Need for Traditional Adoption Flows** – With these sophisticated financial instruments, MSTR doesn’t need a constant stream of retail or even traditional institutional adoption in the usual sense. The system itself, through these bond and repo mechanics, creates the liquidity needed. The money is essentially conjured from market structures already in place for bonds—just now, that capital is flowing into Bitcoin.

**Why Most Investors Don’t Get It**  
A lot of people simply see the headlines: “MSTR Buys More Bitcoin” or “Another Convertible Offering.” They think it’s a high-stakes gamble, akin to putting all their chips on black and hoping it hits. But MSTR’s CEO, Michael Saylor, is playing a far more intricate game—one that involves macroeconomic principles, global market plumbing, and the subtle orchestration of credit expansion via bond issuance.

If you’ve ever wondered why bond offerings are oversubscribed and why sophisticated market participants keep fueling MSTR’s strategy, it’s because these players aren’t just betting on Bitcoin’s price. They’re participating in a financial ecosystem where capital can be created at will and deployed wherever there’s perceived upside. The Bitcoin exposure is a cherry on top—an easily accessible way to gain indirect exposure to a traditionally “hard-to-hold” asset.

**Beyond CFA-Level Analysis**  
I'm sure by now most of you have seen a certain, semi known, CFA on YouTube giving his opinion on this thing. What he's not understanding, (amongst many other things), is that there is literally **endless money** ready to go. A standard CFA curriculum might teach you how bonds work, how repo markets function in theory, and how collateralization reduces credit risk. But MSTR’s approach combines these mechanics in a way that’s more macroeconomic engineering than straightforward investing. It leverages the nature of modern finance—where liquidity can be created through collateral chains and rehypothecation—to accumulate a digital asset that many believe will fundamentally appreciate over time.

This isn’t a simple “buy low, sell high” strategy. It’s about using the fiat/bond market plumbing itself as a tool. When people say “money is made up on the spot,” they’re talking about this exact kind of liquidity generation. And MSTR is capitalizing on it. There is literally **endless money to support this dynamic.**

**TL;DR:**  
MSTR’s Bitcoin play is not merely a bet on BTC price appreciation through ATM-offerings and convertible debt. It’s a masterclass in understanding the deepest layers of financial plumbing—leveraging bond issuance, repo markets, and broker dealers to continuously channel capital into Bitcoin. The result is a kind of financial flywheel that most casual observers can’t see, and that’s exactly why it’s genius. You don’t have to agree with the endgame, but it’s hard not to appreciate the complexity and sophistication of what MSTR is doing behind the scenes.",678

BTC,2024-12-15,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Why Michael Saylor/MSTR Is Essentially Funneling E...,"1. MSTR raises cash by issuing convertible bonds and ATMs. 
2. MSTR buys BTC.
3. BTC goes price up makes MSTR more valuable.
4. Repeat 1-4.

However, as BTC price goes up:
- MSTR accumulates BTC at a slower rate
- BTC arguably becomes less volatile
- MSTR arguably becomes less volatile

And since MSTR thrives by essentially “selling volatility”, then as MSTR becomes less volatile, they raise less cash and in turn acquire less BTC.

It slows down eventually. Nobody knows when and at what price.

BUT…

You just typed a lot of words that mean very little. Most of what you describe is projections of the future or just conjectures. 

The reality is that What MSTR is doing today is still a high risk bet. 

Now - if BTC rapidly matures into a global reserve asset, the bet will pay off, immensely. But if it doesn’t, MSTR not only will go down way faster than Bitcoin, but it might even bankrupt. 

It is uncharted territories for MSTR. ATMs to buy more BTC are genius but they won’t last forever and shareholders will eventually get sick of it. Convertible bonds are effectively call options on MSTR and BTC. Saylor is EXPERIMENTING and trying to bridge tradFi with BITCOIN. He might manage, but again it is NOT a sure bet like you make it sound. It involves leverage on a highly volatile asset.",10

# Ford Would Replace Gold With Energy Currency and Stop Wars



## Declares if Government Will Give Him Muscle Shoals Plant He Can Demonstrate Success of Plan to Substitute Natural Wealth as Basis of World's Money



FLORENCE, Ala., Dec. 3. — Henry Ford and Thomas A. Edison arrived here today to inspect the Muscle Shoals nitrate plant, which the Detroit automobile manufacturer proposes to take over from the government, and almost immediately Mr. Ford declared the purpose of his vast new project. It is not to make money, or, primarily, to stimulate the employment of a million men now idle, or to make the South an industrial center. His purpose, he said, is to end all wars forever.

Henry Ford, by building the world's greatest power plant here on the Tennessee River, expects to eliminate gold as the basis of world wealth and substitute for it something different—the units of power. And by doing this, he said, war would cease, for gold is the cause of war.

""It's very simple when you analyze it,"" said Mr. Ford, ""the cause of all wars is gold. We shall demonstrate to the world two things, first, the practicability, second, the desirability of displacing gold the basis of currency and substituting in its place the world's imperishable natural wealth.

""Almost everybody in the world except the newspapers and the bankers recognizes that civilization has entered on a new era. The newspapers don't see it and the international bankers don't want to see it—it would mean changes in world finance and bankers always oppose changes.

""There is a group of international bankers who today control the bulk of the world's gold supply. No matter to what country they as individuals claim allegiance, they all play the same game to keep the gold they have in their own hands and to get just as much more as possible.

""With the international bankers the fostering, starting and fighting of a war is nothing more nor less than creating an active market for money—a business transaction. If the different countries of the international groups are at war—that makes no difference. No matter who loses the war there have been a great many loans—the gold system always wins. The young men from eighteen to thirty fight the war and are maimed or killed, the internationalists are safe and prosperous.

""Ten years ago I said I intended to put every ounce of brains and energy in me to stopping war. I never meant anything more earnestly, and that's why I want Muscle Shoals. I see a way which, if it can be done, will do more to end war than a thousand years of agitation.

""The essential evil of gold in its relation to war is the fact that it can be controlled. Break the control and you stop war. And the simple way to break the control of these international bankers, the way to end their exploitation of humanity forever, is to remove gold as a basis for the currency of the world.

""Army engineers say it will take $30,000,000 to complete the big dam. But Congress is economical just now and not in a mood to raise the money by taxation. The customary alternative is thirty-year bonds at 4 per cent. The United States, the greatest government in the world, wishing a pesky $30,000,000 to complete a great public benefit, is forced to go to the money sellers.""

""But your plan would upset the money system of the world and might work incalculable harm,"" it was remarked to Mr. Ford.

""Not necessarily; not at all. We need not abolish anything. We need not even abolish the gold standard. Simply forget that there is any such thing as a gold standard and whenever the government needs money for a great serviceable and profitable public improvement, instead of thinking of bonds with their heavy drag of interest charges, think of redeemable non-interest bearing currency.""

""But have you worked out a standard of value?"" Mr. Ford was asked.

""Yes, we have. We will have that ready when Congress wishes to hear about this plan. The standard American dollar is approximately one-twentieth of an ounce of gold. Under the currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to one dollar. It's simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.""

""But how is all this going to stop war?""

Do you understand what a cryptographic hash is built to do? Be non-reversible. There is nothing recoverable from PoW - and that's the point. It poses a high cost on rewrites, expending energy is simply the best known method to force cost expenditure. If a non-energy consuming cost function with all the same properties existed all PoW would switch to that immediately.

BTC,2024-07-18,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Rumors that trump is announcing a strategic bitcoi...,Trump is all about saving the US dollar and the Central Bank.  He could care less about Bitcoin. It is a means to saving the almighty fiat dollar.  Even the latest bipartisan legislation out of the Senate isn’t about Bitcoin.  No legislation has proposed making Bitcoin legal tender.  There is nothing about sound money as legal tender. Nonsense. Just look at his possible choice as Treasury Secretary Jamie Dimon. That should explain everything.,5

If you want to see something hilarious and down-right disturbing, take a look at this (click time ""All"", and then click ""chart""): [Historical Debt Outstanding | U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/historical-debt-outstanding/historical-debt-outstanding). You can make out easily where the government stopped the Bretton Woods system.   
  
Now look at the 80-year trend on M2 money supply:  [M2 (M2SL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

The government is basically a junky in heat - forced to print more and more money in order to finance its ever-growing shopping addiction.

Forget the idiotic meme ""1btc = 1btc"". How do real people in the world value Bitcoin? In USD. What happens when you take a fixed asset, with growing demand, and value it in something that is depreciating exponentially relative to it?

The expression ""Literally can't go tits up"" comes to mind. The only thing in my mind that poses a real threat to Bitcoin's dominance and growth is the potential for an ETF hack. Even then, Bitcoin likely wouldn't die - but it would get set back massively.

All of the above is why - to me - Bitcoin is the single greatest investing opportunity that I believe any of us will ever see in our lives.",16

BTC,2025-03-10,post,Bitcoin,"Can normal people still get wealthy from Bitcoin, or is it just a store of value?","I’m fairly new to stacking Bitcoin and genuinely believe in its long-term value. However, I’m struggling to understand the hype around “generational wealth” that people often mention here. Is that really achievable for average folks who can only stack smaller amounts, especially now that Bitcoin’s price is already high?

If someone owns about 0.1 BTC today, even if Bitcoin hits $1 million per coin in 10-15 years (which would already be an incredible scenario), they’d still only end up with around $100,000. Don’t get me wrong, $100,000 is a lot of money, particularly for someone in a developing country. But realistically, that isn’t the life changing, early retirement amount that I keep hearing about.

If a regular person stacks roughly $100 to $300 each month, how far could Bitcoin realistically take them over the next 10 or 20 years? Is it more practical to think of Bitcoin as just a good way to protect against inflation rather than expecting it to provide life changing wealth?

I’m curious to hear realistic experiences and opinions from people who’ve stacked consistently over the years, especially those who started small. Has your perspective changed about what’s possible with Bitcoin? What’s a realistic long term goal for regular stackers today?

Thanks!",192

If you own 0.1 bitcoin in 2040, you're probably looking at a decent amount of money. Not Lambo, yatch and hookers kind of money, but probably ""I own the house I always wanted"" kinda of money. Or ""my kids should have everything they need"" kind of money.

And then question everything. Ask yourself questions about why Bitcoin could fail. And try to answer these questions realistically. No one in the world has found a reason in 16 years.

And then think about how hard money like BTC promotes economic growth.

And then think about what value it could have. Especially if it is also used for trading all over the world.

Also, think about what FOMO looks like at the state level if the US has refined its Bitcoin Reserve a bit more.

BTC,2025-03-10,comment,Bitcoin,"Comment on: Can normal people still get wealthy from Bitcoin, ...","Here's my take on explaining Bitcoin to someone new

Price doesn't matter. Stop thinking in Dollars $$$ for a moment, and read the following.

It's estimated that 2025 will increase the number of millionaires in the entire world to 84 million different millionaires

There's 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist. There can never be more. There can be less, if some is lost. It's been documented a lot has been lost. For simplicity,  we'll pretend it's still 21 million Bitcoin that exists, nothing lost

Pretend no one owns Bitcoin, at all. All of the 84 million millionaires decide they will own all of the Bitcoin themselves, split evenly.

There would only be enough for each millionaire to own 0.25 Bitcoin each

Bitcoin is $82,600 at the time of writing this

0.25 Bitcoin currently is worth $20,650

Now imagine trying to split Bitcoin between millionaires and regular folk. There's not very much Bitcoin left, is there? This makes it valuable, well 1 of the reasons",14

Your time horizon is off, it won’t take 10 to 15 years for bitcoin to reach 1 million. We’re likely looking at 10 to 15 million in that amount of time. Remember, the bitcoin is a finite asset, and once the available supply runs out on exchanges, with the same or increasing demand, the price goes parabolic very fast. It’s an exponential outcome.

BTC,2025-03-25,post,Bitcoin,Bitcoin bottom predictions?,I understand bitcoin has a cycle where 1 out of every 3-4 years it has a major crash. And I also know “time in the market beats timing the market” but I want to know if you guys think we will go lower from here (88k) it looks like we are about to either have a major dip which would be good for someone like myself who owns none. Should I wait it out and try to get something lower than the 80ks and dca or buy now and continue to dca or scratch all of that and contribute to my Roth IRA using the funds I would use to buy bitcoin,170
BTC,2025-03-25,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Bitcoin bottom predictions?...,"Just DCA.  Nobody knows what the price is going to do.

  
It likely that this bull run is not over.  We could still go up hundreds of thousands of dollars over the next few months. This is especially true if the US government starts buying or one of the magnificent 7 starts to buy.

Its possible that the ""cycles"" are over and bitcoin doesn't have a serious drop but just steadily increases from here on out.  The fact that most of the bitcoin has already been mined, so halving events don't cause that big of a supply shock, gives this theory some legs.

Its also possible but unlikely that 109k was the top and we have a normal 80 to 85% drop to 16 to 23k.

Its also possible that bitcoin is dead and going to zero.

BTC,2025-03-25,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Bitcoin bottom predictions?...,"In a typical bear market, Bitcoin has seen corrections of around -75%, which would mean a potential bottom around $27K if the top is already in. That said, I personally think there’s still room to climb until Q4 this year, possibly reaching $130K, as some Elliott Wave targets suggest.

On the bearish side, $100K was a major psychological level, and plenty of big players took profits around that Wyckoff) distribution phase.

One key factor to consider: Bitcoin has never experienced a full-blown recession. And right now, several indicators are flashing warnings, Yield curve inversion (a classic recession signal), Sahm Rule triggering, Polymarket recession odds jumping from 20% to 40%, CPI dipping, hinting at economic slowdown.

On top of that, from a technical perspective, there’s a bearish Elliott Wave count suggesting we’re in wave 5 of wave 5 of wave 5 (measured since its creation), the final push before a major correction (ABC retracement). If a recession does hit, it would be uncharted territory for Bitcoin, which was created after the last financial crisis.",5

If it follows the four year cycle, it should dip just below the previous cycle's high. The previous cycle high was about 69k in fall of 2021.

That said, while it could come back down to those levels (49k - 70k, avg it out to 60k) depending on economic conditions, it’s also a bullish clue that we’ve seen nothing yet. Because of all the retests / consolidation we’ve had over the past few months, there’d be nothing abnormal if bitcoin rallied to 150-200k.

BTC,2024-12-27,post,Bitcoin,How to explain Bitcoin’s real value to my 72yr old uncle,"Hi everyone, i’m trying to explain the real value of Bitcoin to my uncle (72yrs old, physicist). He’s been studying economics and the stock market for a few months. He understands how stocks and markets work, but he struggles to see Bitcoin as a store of value or understand what it’s actually backed by.

The other day, he told me he sees gold as a store of value because it has “intrinsic value”, as you can melt it, make things with it, etc. But when it comes to Bitcoin, he doesn’t understand it in the same way.

I tried to explain to him that the most important characteristics are:
 - The fixed supply of 21 million BTC ensures scarcity, so as demand grows (due to the constant devaluation of fiat currencies), Bitcoin’s value should increase.
 - Its utility as a peer-to-peer payment system that bypasses banks and intermediaries makes it unique and valuable, especially in a world where trust in financial institutions is declining.

Despite this, he wasn’t still convinced. He told me he kind of understands the point of the BTC fixed quantity, but that he doesn’t trust Bitcoin too much because of its high volatility and price changes. However, he’s interested in the topic, and I got him into investing a few dollars, as i convinced him that a bullrun might take place in 2025. 

So my question to the community is:
 - What arguments or reasons do you usually use to explain Bitcoin’s “intrinsic value” to someone?
 - How can we better connect Bitcoin’s concept of value to someone who thinks in terms of physical utility and tangibility?

Thanks!",104

But yeah I almost never bother anymore.  I chat occasionally with my dad and little brother but that is about it and even then only when they show some interest.

Ie...

Is gold valuable? Inherently valuable?(no)

Gold is valuable because of 'want'. People want it, thus it is valuable.

People usually want it because it's rare, kind of finite, can't be easily reproduced, is objectively pretty, and recently has an actual use in electronics. Therefore people want it, thus it has value. But....

Did precolonial native americans find gold valuable? No.

Why not?

Was it rare? Yes. Was it shiny still? Yes. Etc

If it was still all those things then why didn't it have value? It had no value because they didn't need it. Thus they didn't want it.

People want bitcoin

People want bitcoin because it's rare, finite, trustless, decentralized etc. Thus because of want, bitcoin has VALUE.

Value is based on want and want alone

BTC,2024-12-27,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: How to explain Bitcoin’s real value to my 72yr old...,"Bitcoin is like a satellite in the sky that allows everyone to send capital or transfer ownership of a tokenized asset to anyone, anywhere with 30 minute or less settlement time 24/7/365, ZERO counterparty risk, ZERO censorship, and ZERO borders. These transfers share all of the common characteristics of money. Like a gold bar, the owner of a BTC is the person who literally holds it in his hand, i.e. it is a bearer asset which cannot be double-spent and transactions cannot be repudiated. Unlike a gold bar, you can transfer BTC instantaneously and you can even store it in your brain.

But a satellite is expensive to build and maintain, who pays for that and what is their incentive? Those are the miners, who purchase mining hardware and the energy to run it. The mining rewards are a fee and optional tip from each transaction, as well as the fixed block reward. For example, Marathon (a mining company) spends about $1MM on energy consumption each day, and receives block rewards of $3-4MM per day. Ultimately (over many decades) this gap should shrink, until MR=MC. As long as people are interested in transferring capital to each other across the world, there will be demand for the network and incentives come automatically from the participants.

Consider another hypothetical: suppose there are no natural diamonds anywhere on Earth, but we know how to create them by putting coal into an enormous machine, pumping tons of energy and time into this machine, until a diamond comes out. Now people everywhere can perform transactions using diamonds as money with the assurance that it's value is undergirded by the expensive cost to produce it. Bitcoin is this process, but democratic and completely mathematically secure and stable in the long term, and transferrable at the speed of light.",4

BTC,2025-06-14,post,Bitcoin,Claim: Bitcoin is worthless because it doesn’t have intrinsic value,"Is it a problem if bitcoin doesn’t have intrinsic value? The following point shows that the apparent issue of bitcoin not having intrinsic value is really not an issue at all: 

Nothing that is traded actually has intrinsic value. The value is always instrumental in some form or another. Every commodity or asset that is perceived to have intrinsic value has a function that gives it its value. 

For example gold is considered having intrinsic value because it can be used in industry or as jewelry. But this value is also instrumental since it is a usecase in a certain context. 

If it is a problem that bitcoin doesn’t have intrinsic value then all commodities have a problem. 

The instrumental value of bitcoin is enormous since, among other things, it is a life boat for the biggest financial problem in the history of mankind, the unstoppable train of fiat currency. ",18

In other words, nobody reads them and nobody cites them (a sign of either unreliable source or more trivial reports). I'm sure there are good articles in that journal somewhere but on average, it lacks the quality to compete with other journals.

For example, Journal of Finance, which is a well respected journal in that area has an impact factor of about 8-ish.

Having said that, personally (I might piss off some finance academics here) I find financial and economic journals have pretty low predictive power because typically, the models need of a lot of assumptions. I'm not in finance but had a friend who was in economics PhD while I was getting a neuroscience PhD, and for the few papers I understood somewhat, the arguments, while informative and somewhat intuitive, seemed much weaker than what you'd see with natural science papers.

I did skim through the paper, and like I said.. finance models have too unrealistic assumptions. For example, their model assumes that demand is either constant or goes up (demand multiplier parameter starts at 1, no change). I bet the outcome range will look pretty scary if you put a negative there (i.e. lessening demand). Realistically, we know there are bull and bear markets. There are times when cumulatively people buy more, and times when people sell more.

Also, have you seen a free fall in the market when the order books are thin (i.e. little liquidity)? Bid and ask spread gets crazy and price dumps. This past April 2025 in S&P was a good example. And a lot of crypto liquidation event can serve as an example too.

Just be careful.. even with scientific papers. There's so much fraud in science too. Intentionally or unintentionally. At the end of the day, people are people. They make mistakes, they can be clouded by their judgement (i.e. biased), etc.",26

BTC,2025-05-13,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Peer reviewed article released this year predicts ...,"The article ""https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/18/2/66"" by Murray A. Rudd and Dennis Porter (2025) develops a rigorous economic model to forecast Bitcoin prices based on its fixed, inelastic supply (capped at 21 million coins) and evolving demand dynamics, particularly institutional adoption and long-term holding behavior.

Summary of Key Points:

Bitcoin Supply Characteristics:**
  Bitcoin’s supply is fixed and perfectly inelastic with a 21 million coin cap.
  Supply expansion slows via periodic halvings (block reward reductions) roughly every 4 years; the latest occurred in April 2024.
  Liquid supply is significantly less than total issuance due to lost, long-term held (HODL) coins, and coins held as strategic reserves.

Demand Side Factors:**
  Demand is modeled using a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) demand function with parameters calibrated to market data.
  Institutional, sovereign, and corporate accumulation (strategic reserves) reduces liquid supply, intensifying scarcity.
  Credit-driven demand expansion and increasing adoption shift demand curves outward over time.

Model Framework:**
  The model sets April 20, 2024 (fourth halving) as the baseline with:
    Issued Bitcoins: ~19.7 million.
    Liquid supply estimated at ~11.2 million.
    Market price at $
64,858 USD.
  Projections extend to the seventh halving (~April 2036), a 12-year horizon.
  Model parameters can be adjusted for demand growth (demand shift multiplier), daily Bitcoin withdrawals into reserves, elasticity, adoption curve timing, and lost coins.
  Uses a discrete daily supply-demand equilibrium approach implemented in Analytica software.

Price Forecasts and Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Demand Multiplier (D) | Daily Withdrawals to Reserve | Forecast Price Range by 2036 (USD) | Notes |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| Baseline | 1x                    | 0 to 2000                   | Approx.
$62,000 to $
106,000       | Near current price, stable |
| Moderate | 10x - 20x             | 0 to 2000                   |
$639,000 to $
2.2 million          | Moderate adoption, growing reserves |
| Bull     | 30x - 40x             | 0 to 2000                   |
$1.9 million to $
4.4 million      | Aggressive institutional adoption and high withdrawals |
| Conservative (Dec 2024 Recalibration) | D=20, elasticity ~ -2.1 | 0 to 4000                 |
$98,577 to $102,808 (as of Dec 2024) | Prices ~$1M by mid-2028 with withdrawals |
| Bull (Fast Adoption)          | D=30, elasticity ~ -1.8 | 0 to 4000                 | $1M by early 2027, up to$5M by early 2031 | High institutional demand |

Price Trajectory Insights:**
  Price appreciation is sensitive to both increased demand and reductions in liquid supply.
  Modest withdrawals to long-term reserves (e.g., thousands per day) could drive Bitcoin to $
1 million+ within 3-6 years.
  High withdrawal rates accelerate supply shocks, causing hyperbolic price growth and increased volatility.
  Demand growth has a more substantial short-run impact than modest changes in liquid supply.
  Power law models predicting decreasing volatility may be incorrect; price volatility may increase as supply dwindles.

Comparisons with Other Models:**
  Model forecasts align well with MicroStrategy’s financial models (multi-million dollar price by 2036-2045).
  ARK Invest’s forecast (
$3.8M by 2030) suggests even higher demand multipliers or more constrained supply scenarios.

Limitations & Future Work:**
  Assumptions about lost coins, HODL behavior, and market elasticities remain uncertain.
  The framework excludes complex network effects, Layer-2 impacts, and macro shocks explicitly.
  Future modelling could include stochastic simulations, multi-commodity interactions, or survey-derived demand curves.

Bitcoin Price Prediction Schedule Summary:

| Date/Period               | Event/Predictor                      | Forecast Price Range (USD)            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| April 2024 (Baseline)    | Price at 4th halving (start)         | $
64,858                             |
| Mid-December 2024        | Market price update; scenario recalibration | ~
$98,577 - $
102,808               |
| Mid-2027 to Early 2028    | Bull scenario (high demand, withdrawals)  |
$1 million+                        |
| Mid-2028 to 2030          | Moderate to high adoption & withdrawals  | $1M to$2.5 million                |
| Early 2031                | Bull scenario peak prices            | Up to $
5 million                   |
| April 2036 (7th halving)  | Long-term equilibrium prices         |
$62k (low adoption, no withdrawals) to multiple millions (high demand & withdrawals) |

Summary of What Drives Price Increases:

Institutional & sovereign investors withdrawing Bitcoin from the liquid market (strategic reserves).
Growth in adoption shifting demand curves outward significantly (multipliers 10x to 40x).
Rising scarcity as the supply schedule approaches the hard cap.
The interaction of inelastic supply with evolving demand creates potential for steep price appreciation and volatility.

Now, as it’s going back up again, they may be selling because they are back in the green and the volatility is more than they can handle, for a non-maxi it’s a perfectly good reason to take a step back and re-evaluate your risk profile and volatility tolerance. There is no reason to shame them. I’m sure we were all there at one point.

I don’t see how it can be both. If it’s just a store of value then wouldn’t investing be a better option? If it’s digital gold as they say wouldn’t you not want very much exposure to it? People don’t even like gold now, but even when they did you were only supposed to have 5% or so in your portfolio. 

I do understand that maybe there is still more adoption that will take place so money will still flow into bitcoin pushing the price up, but if it’s just a store of value that has to stop happening at some point right? If its market cap is around 2 trillion currently, bitcoin getting to a millions means it would be 20 trillion. Golds market cap is only 17 trillion.  Even if it got to a million that means that’s only 10x. Are there not safer investments out there that can 10x easier? If it’s a store of value wouldn’t it only keep up with inflation over time?",11

BTC,2024-12-28,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is bitcoin a store of value or an investment?...,"A store of value can also be an investment. They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the best assets to buy as a store of value or an investment are usually the best because they have qualities of both. 

  
A store of value is an asset that maintains its purchasing power over time.

This means it holds its value or increases in value, making it suitable for saving and preserving wealth.

An investment is an asset acquired to generate income or appreciate in value.

This means you're putting money into something with the expectation of making a profit or seeing its value increase.

Therefore, an asset that is a good store of value (like gold, real estate, or certain stocks) can also be a good investment because it has the potential to appreciate in value over time.

[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/store-of-value/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/store-of-value/)

Gold:

Historically, gold has been considered a good store of value, meaning it holds its value well during times of economic uncertainty. It's also an investment because its price can fluctuate, and investors can buy and sell it to profit from those price changes.

Real Estate:

Real estate can be a good store of value because it tends to appreciate in value over time, particularly in areas with strong economic growth. It's also an investment because you can rent out properties to generate income or sell them for a profit.

Stocks:

Stocks can be both a store of value and an investment. When you buy stocks, you're essentially buying a small piece of ownership in a company. If the company does well, the value of your stock can increase, making it a good investment. Over the long term, stocks have historically been a good store of value, as they tend to appreciate in value over time. 

In essence, a store of value is a characteristic of an asset, and if that asset has the potential to appreciate in value over time, it can also be considered an investment.

Fiat is inflationary and without limit. The purchasing power of a dollar has decreased significantly over the last century. But Bitcoin is deflationary and with a hard limit. Because it will have value in the future (due to it's intrinsic properties), it's purchasing power will increase.

Say a house in 2012 cost $300,000 USD. That same house in 2024 will cost $900,000.

In 2012 that house cost 600,000 BTC. That same house in 2024 will cost 9 Bitcoin. When a single Bitcoin is worth over $10M USD, you'll be able to buy a mansion for a fraction of one.

2025 we are going to see the unprecedented pump as institutional investors, corporations and governments start buying en masse.",2
BTC,2024-12-28,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is bitcoin a store of value or an investment?...,"Copy-paste from another thread I commented on:

Yes, it's definitely a store of value.
We are lucky enough to be around in the nascent stages where the trade is incredibly asymmetric.
Bitcoin is the trade of the generation. It acts like a speculative asset now. However, we will see its volatility dampen over time (especially with more ETF/corporate participation). Once the volatility reduces significantly, it will more closely resemble a traditional store of value where its nominal price will reflect an index of currency devaluation.

It is almost impossible that Bitcoin has not outpaced everything in one's portfolio when held for more than a couple of years. Even when buying a cycle top, the gain between the entry price and the next cycle top is greater than the percentage gain that can be achieved with most other investment types. Given enough time, the out-performance becomes more glaringly obvious.",2
BTC,2024-12-28,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is bitcoin a store of value or an investment?...,"Study Bitcoin. No one can tell you what it is because it's more than one thing to various degrees. The discovery of Bitcoin digital scarcity has wider implications. Much like how no one could really explain all the implications of the internet protocol in the 90s, no one can fully explain the implications of a pristine digital risk-free monetary protocol. But by studying it you can get a sense for it. It's a lot more than Gold.",2

We've gone from enthusiasts, to individual speculators, to institutions, to now governments over the past 15 years.  Bitcoin is one of those things which appears to operate off a feedback loop where it becomes increasingly more compelling the more it is adopted.  For example, the same institutions and large investors buying into it today at $100k considered it to be too risky and off limits back when it was $1,000. 

If that feedback loop phenomenon is the correct read, then global reserve currency is a reasonable conclusion.

As far as $475k by Q4-2025?  Probably not but anything is possible.  Anyone confidently throwing out numbers and timings is full of shit considering how massive Bitcoin's range still is right now.",3

BTC,2024-11-23,post,Bitcoin,My Accidental Bitcoin Journey Ended Tonight,"I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment.

Maybe I played the game horribly.  Maybe I would have $700K worth of bitcoin if I stuck to my original plan of keeping 7 bitcoins.  I don’t know. Feels pretty good to turn a pretty small investment into a 25% down payment on an investment property though.

I’ll continue to occasionally buy bitcoin after this, but I recognize that I may never afford to ever get close to owning 1 BTC ever again, let alone multiple.  But I’m ok with it.  I got a debt-free wedding and an investment property out of it.  I’m happy.

Just a little story to say that it’s ok to use your bitcoin to fund your life along the way.  It’s likely part of the journey.  Be well. 


Edit:  I’m blown away by all the responses!  I honestly expected it to be 80% negative.  So, thank you to those well wishers.  I honestly get and understand the negative sentiment.  I found myself in an unbelievably lucky position and squandered it all away (according to naysayers).  I will continue to believe in and buy bitcoin.  There’s still plenty of time to invest in it as a retirement option.  I wanted passive income and diversification, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.  Cheers. 

Edit 2:  Lots of comments/questions about taxes.  Yes, it’s all capital gains. Yes, we are covered. Long story short, my wife worked for a major tech company that paid her in stock as part of her salary. Instead of cashing her shares every month, she kept them and lived off just her salary.  That stock tanked 3 years ago and has lost 70+% of its value.  She finally sold yesterday so that we can write off her losses against my gains.",8223

The early innings of this bull cycle are setting up for something we’ve never seen before. The ETF inflows alone are swallowing up supply at 2x the daily mined Bitcoin, and that’s before you even factor in MicroStrategy, corporate treasuries, and relentless retail DCA.

Then you’ve got the real institutional wave—pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and mutual funds—barely scratching the surface. The 13F filings already show 30% institutional exposure, and that’s just the start.

Bitcoin is moving into its next phase: competing with gold. Gold ETFs are bleeding capital, and the smart money is reallocating into BTC. Once the first major sovereign nation formally adds Bitcoin to its reserves, the game theory kicks in—others will be forced to follow, and then it’s all bets off.

BTC,2025-06-01,post,Bitcoin,When people say that gold has intrinsic value that BTC doesn’t.,"In 2024, industrial gold consumption was about 330t. About 90% of this was recycled from scrap, at a cost of only tens of dollars per oz, so only about 33t of new gold was needed. In 2024, mine production was about 3,700t, meaning that less than 1% of this was needed for industry. All above-ground gold currently used for value-storage (jewelry, bars, coins) amounts to about 184,000t. If suddenly gold was no longer wanted for jewelry, bars and coins, and global supply was redirected to industrial needs not met by recycling, we would have a 5,600 year supply available at current consumption rates without needing to dig any more out of the ground, at a tiny fraction of the current price.

Also, as I understand:

Technically speaking, intrinsic value refers to the underlying value of an asset as opposed to the fluctuating price on the market.

Gold (and bitcoin) are considered commodities which don't have intrinsic values, just a spot price. It's 'value' is whatever you bought/sold it for.

Companies have an intrinsic value (think of all those stock picking lessons) because there's the price you can buy it at (spot price) and then there's the value it can bring you just by holding it (intrinsic value, the cash flows).",1

You can have a sentiment for BTC “of course in this group.”
But BTC is still used by very small group of people worldwide, of course it is still growing every year, neverthless gold has proof of value for thousands year worldwide.

Every 100k is 2T of implied usd value, it depends how much liquidity there is in the global market to move upward, its not a dollar for dollar injection to get us to the higher targets.

300k+ possible if things fall into place, that puts bitcoin in 6T territory for this cycle, maybe underestimating the speed of todays markets.

Macro: Big tailwind from US gov probable ie bank custody, taxes, sovereign fund, loan vehicles, in-kind funding/loans, reclassification for small purchases,wall street fully on board, corporate America potential for bitcoin treasury strategy, other sovereign states following or leading ahead.

Each of these variables depends on timing. The potential, sparing us of any major downsides with usa and global economies, are the 2 cycles inclusive of this one being gigantic.",25

BTC,2025-06-04,post,Bitcoin,"~3 Year Update: I Took Out $150,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Bitcoin!","**tl;dr:**  Over the course of the past \~3 years, I took out \~$150,000 in personal loans and 0% credit card balance transfer loans to purchase 4.75 Bitcoin. I've paid \~$15,000 in interest so far and currently have a \~$40,000 remaining balance. 

Today, June 4th, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000 which brings the current value of my 4.75₿ to $498,750. 

The average price I paid is \~$35,000 per Bitcoin. 

My total cost basis is \~$165,000  ($150k in loans + $15k in interest). 

This comes to \~201% unrealized profit or \~$333,000 in dollar terms. 



**What’s new since my last update?**

I know that for like the past 3 updates I said I wouldn’t take out any more loans, but I lied again! I took out another 0% balance transfer loan for $25,000 to purchase 0.25₿ when Bitcoin hit $100k. 

I was so close to having it all paid off too. I was down to just $20,000 remaining balance, but I simply couldn’t resist.



**What’s next?** 

I have no plans to sell any of it. Just buy and hold. Retire early. I service the debt with earned income from my job. I can easily afford the payments. I should have it all paid off by mid 2026… so long as I don’t take out even more loans to buy even more Bitcoin! 

Also, as mentioned in my 2.5 year update, I paid off all of the personal loans! So no more interest charges accruing. The remaining \~$40,000 I owe is from the balance transfers which have 0% interest for at least the next 6-12 months depending upon the card. I'm sure I'll have them all paid off before then. 

I’ve made updates every \~6 months or so. Feel free to view my post history to learn more about my strategy.



**Most Frequently Asked Questions I get?**



**1. Why take out loans when I could just buy Bitcoin from earned income?** 

If I only did that, then I would not have been able to buy nearly as much Bitcoin as I did at the lowest prices. Back in 2022, I knew we were in a bear market. I also knew that it wouldn’t last more than a couple years. 

I view it as a “Reverse DCA."" I pay the loans each month instead of DCA. This allowed me to buy a lot more Bitcoin than I otherwise would have been able to buy. I can easily afford the monthly payments to service the debt. I borrow responsibly.

If I had just DCA’d these past 3 years, I would have only been able to acquire less than half of what I got from using the loan strategy. The loans allowed me to buy more Bitcoin when the price was in the $16-35K range.

I you’ve been following my updates, you’d know that the majority of my 4.75₿ was purchased from February 2022 to October 2023 when it was in the aforementioned $16-35k range. 

My recent purchase of 0.25₿ for $25,000 was kinda painful to be honest. Especially considering that just 2.5 years ago that much would have gotten me \~1.25₿… big yikes!



**2. This is too risky. You’re insane. You’re gambling. Never take out loans to buy Bitcoin!**

Taking out loans to buy assets is fine, so long as you can afford to responsibly service the debt. Just don’t take out loans to buy liabilities!!! This is what most Americans get wrong. They take out loans to buy liabilities such as vacations, shopping sprees, cars, jewelry, etc…

I have a thesis an a strategy…

My thesis is simple: due to reckless fiscal and monetary policy (money printing) by our government, the US dollar will continue to depreciate in value, i.e. inflation. 

My strategy: take out loans in USD and buy hard money like BTC which will appreciate in value against the USD. 

The strategy is basically a speculative attack on the US dollar. Wall Street traders have been doing the same thing for decades. Have you hear of the Yen Carry Trade? I’m doing the same thing except with USD and BTC.

If you look at all the successful, filthy rich Wall Street investors, you’ll see that they all have one thing in common: they used leverage (borrowing) to buy assets. None of them got rich by working hard, saving money and investing in the S&P500. They all use intelligent leverage and they all concentrate it on a few high conviction assets. 

For myself, I’m not so concerned about becoming filthy rich, I just want to have financial security, independence and sovereignty. This is why I Bitcoin.

BTC,2024-12-05,post,Bitcoin,I went from broke to millionaire in 7 years on a middle-class income thanks to Bitcoin,"I'm posting this anonymously for obvious reasons.

I shared my story here four years ago. If you are curious, you can find it. I've been involved with r/Bitcoin since the summer of 2017 when I first bought Bitcoin in the $2,000 range. I distinctly remember celebrating 250,000 subs here, and this subreddit has been a great educational and meme-motivational resource over that time. 

The Bull Market of 2017 was a wild ride. I experienced my first FOMO as the price went from $2,000 to $20,000. During that up-and-down cycle, I bought around one whole Bitcoin. I bought another full Bitcoin when it dropped to $4,000 in 2018. I felt satisfied with my 2 BTC, but my confidence waned so I didn’t continue stacking over the next 2 years. 

In the spring of 2020, I sold my house, switched jobs, and suddenly found myself sitting on $30,000 in cash from the sale of my home and around 55k in a 401k. I watched as Bitcoin went from 4k to 7, 8, 9, 10, instead of going down to zero as the critics claimed. I decided to go “all-in” with these funds so that’s what I did. I bought around 3 Bitcoin with the cash and the equivalent of just under 5 BTC in GBTC in a new 401k. This brought me to just under 10 Bitcoin split between private custody and a 401k. 

I watched history repeat itself in the fall of 2020, but this time, I had some real exposure to better gains. I watched as my life savings went from around $100,000 to over $600,000 at the top of the cycle in early 2021. Then, I watched as my roughly $600,000 returned to around $170,000 during the bottom of the bear market in 2022. That was tough to witness, but I looked at it and said “I’m still up from where I started.” Once you get past a certain amount of savings, the big swings hit differently. Even during the bear market, I knew I still had at least a 1-year emergency fund, which comforted me.Fast-forward to a short while ago when Bitcoin hit 92k. I soon realized that with the equity in our home and my exposure to BTC, my wife and I were finally millionaires. We’re still driving the same beater cars to work. I rarely sell our BTC, but when I do, I try to buy things/ experiences that will improve the quality of life for my family, and I’m quick to replace what I sold.

I make a middle-class income so I don’t often need to sell for the things I want/ need. Whenever I see a used car, 4-wheeler, boat, or new home I’m tempted to buy, I think to myself “I’d rather have Bitcoin.” The peace of mind it offers far outweighs the benefits of more junk. I used to tell myself I’d pay off my mortgage using proceeds from Bitcoin, but my mortgage is only about 9% of my take-home pay, and the interest rate is lower than inflation. I believe we will see 250k-280k by the end of next year, and the cycle will start again.

One downside to having such a nice safety net is that work has become very tedious. I have very little motivation to put in the extra time or to go “above and beyond.” I do my job, I do it well, I make money for my employer, but I’m not pushing for more like I would if I were still broke. I’ll post again in four more years with an update. I’m hoping to retire by 2030-2034. Stay safe out there, and only invest in Bitcoin what you’re willing to keep!

  
\*edit\* There seems to be a ton of questions regarding whether or not I was actually broke so let me clarify. ""Broke"" to me means you only have a couple thousand dollars to your name. You can be broke and be making money. There are people who make 150k a year and they are broke. In 2017, our household income was probably around 92-95k so just under 48k per person. Earlier in 2017, we bought a home with 100% financing because we couldn't save up a deposit. That home was worth around 135k. We had a 4.5% mortgage rate on a 15-year mortgage. 



We only had $1,000 in an emergency fund when we first started buying Bitcoin. We managed to cut back on some expenses and gradually bought Bitcoin all the way up and down. I don't think we became wholecoiners until the market crashed. I seem to recall the second Bitcoin was purchased aound $4,000, and that money was from a tax return check. That's one of the only ways broke people get a nice chunk of money at once. Trump raised the child tax credit so we got a nice check from that. 

  
We sold our house in 2020 for a little over 200k, so we walked away with like 65k. We then put 25k deposit on a new house, bought some furniture, riding lawnmower, etc and when the dust settled we still had about 30k leftover. That's where the bulk of the Bitcoin came from. Well, that plus the transferring of the 401k. I hope this clears things up.",8328

Upon scanning it the public transactions show the time the funds were sent to the wallet and about 6 months later the amount was sent out of the wallet. This was back in 2019. She thought back about it and said back then she just left her wallet out on the table and she remembers having guests back then. Best guess is they took a photo of the private key and sent away.,14

Now you have some cash and no BTC. Do you take the 4% hit to your holdings and buy back at $99k now? Do you wait to see if it drops again and risk watching as it rockets up to a new ATH? 

People need to learn that this strategy isn't investing in the potential of bitcoin, it is gambling, pure and simple. Gambling on the crazy idea that somehow you know how to time the market like a pro. You might as well just take your money and head to a casino. Just like trading on the BTC price, you can get lucky and come out ahead sometimes, but in the long run, the house always wins.

BTC,2025-06-20,post,Bitcoin,Why Valuing Bitcoin in Dollars Is Keeping You Poor,"One of the biggest misunderstandings I see on here is people constantly valuing Bitcoin in dollars. I get it. We all live in a fiat world for now. But if you’re serious about understanding Bitcoin, you have to stop thinking in fiat terms. If you don’t, you’re showing that you don’t truly understand what Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is not an investment to cash out of. It’s not a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s not digital stocks. It’s a decentralized protocol created to replace fiat money, not coexist with it forever.

If you’re measuring Bitcoin’s success by how many dollars you can get for it, you’re still mentally chained to the very system Bitcoin was created to free you from.

Let’s imagine fiat becomes obsolete in the future. If Bitcoin becomes the dominant global currency, everything will be priced in sats. The value of goods and services will actually go down in Bitcoin terms because Bitcoin’s supply is fixed. Your purchasing power will rise the longer you hold.

This flips the entire economic model. Instead of being punished for saving, you’re rewarded. Instead of being forced to spend or invest just to stay ahead of inflation, you can opt out.

This is the core philosophy behind Bitcoin. It is the separation of money from state and a complete reorganization of incentives, energy, and human cooperation.

Time and energy are the most scarce and valuable resources we have as human beings. Every decision we make revolves around how we spend them. Money, at its core, is supposed to be a tool to measure and preserve both. But we’ve never had fair, incorruptible money that could actually do that, until Bitcoin.

If you want to go deeper and actually get it, I highly encourage you to study the work of Jeff Booth and Michael Saylor. Jeff explains how technological deflation is being suppressed by inflationary fiat systems. Saylor breaks down how Bitcoin is thermodynamically sound, a way to store and transmit energy (money) across time and space.

The rabbit hole goes much deeper than price charts and halvings. If you’re reading this and feel like something still doesn’t fully click, good. That’s the beginning.

Keep going. Bitcoin isn’t here to make you rich. It’s here to make you free.

Stay curious. Stay sovereign. Keep learning.

I’m wishing everybody the best on their journeys.

Cheers!

BTC,2025-06-27,post,Bitcoin,DCA vs Taking Out a Loan to Buy Bitcoin: Data Analysis,"**TLDR**: From 2017 to today, taking a loan (with a 10% interest rate) would have **beaten a straightforward DCA strategy 65.5%** of the time!   
2 out of 3 times is pretty insane.  
  
I've noticed a ton of discussions to take out a loan to buy Bitcoin. I was thinking of doing it myself, but wanted to crunch the numbers behind it. So, here I am, to settle the debate. The results are not surprising at all:  
\- Starting in Bull markets: DCA typically wins out.  
\- Starting in Bear markets: Taking a loan to buy BTC significantly outperforms DCA

Quick summary of the **methodology**:  
\- Loan interest rate: 10%  
\- Loan term: 5 years  
\- Modeled like a mortgage: Each monthly payment accrues 1/60th of the BTC ownership  
\- Upfront deposit of 20% (similar to a mortgage)  
\- DCA strategy matches the same monthly payment + deposit amount in BTC purchases  
  
I'm planning to refine this further. let me know if you guys want to follow along:  
\- Right now, I haven't even factored in the full upside potential you get from having immediate access to the entire BTC amount (only accounted for equity paid). Is that a better way to model this? Would love someone else's thoughts.  
\- Considering turning this into a comprehensive tool or product. Do you think there's a demand or need for something like this? I'm thinking about a solution for this

Would appreciate your thoughts, critiques, or any suggestions to improve this analysis!  
Cheers!",138

Scarcity mostly has value only for people with low time preference, who don't live just day to day or paycheck to paycheck. Who are interested in a store if value that increases over time. So it is with bitcoin. It can't be forged, it is extremely scarce and historically increases value over time. The added feature that it has over other forms of money is its digital nature, transferable anywhere any time. Because of its exponential price gain over time It is also a time chain: An hour's work to buy bitcoin today equates to ten hours of work in 5 years.",2

Before that I was dumping money everywhere. The more I learned about crypto the more I learned about Bitcoin. The more I learned and got involved in Bitcoin the more money I saved and I haven’t lost any money since. To me that told me all I needed to know and the best way I found to learn “my personal experience”. I’m still learning and I don’t think we ever stop learning,1

BTC,2025-07-06,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: What is the real value of bitcoin?...,"one of its key values is that it is not hard to get.  the permissionless access to it reduces all of the friction that comes with other forms of money.  easy access means a larger more robust network and anyone can join in around the world with an internet connection and a computer.  this allows it to hold value accross space.

the other value is that it does not decay or erode.  the pure data can be transmitted infinitely into the future, so long as humans have a use for it, we will maintain its operation.  this allows it to hold value across time.",1
BTC,2025-07-06,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: What is the real value of bitcoin?...,"Many people confuse value and price, the value of bitcoin is independence from government currencies the value is a function of demand, price is a function of this demand, but some demand bitcoin who are not only interested in independence, but also getting rich. This happens if someone in the future buys it from you at a higher price, but they also hope for the same thing, that can be due to inflation, higher real term demand or just speculation/hype. We all know though that everything comes to an end, how far away is that? Who knows, probably somewhere between now and the heat death of the universe.",1

BTC,2025-05-25,post,Bitcoin,What scenario is scarier. That Bitcoin will fall 50% into a bear market. Or that we'll never see a Bitcoin bear market ever again.,"I genuinely find the latter more concerning. With the current geopolitical Bitcoin reserve fomo it could potentially require a global catastrophe for us to see a bear market with similar proportions to previous cycles ever again(Let alone that there scenarios where a world catastrophe only strengthens bitcoin).  
  
Last cycle there was the ""super cycle"" narrative hopium peak and we ended up with a cascading disaster.  
  
This cycle people are more skeptical of the super cycle and we might just end up with it.

It's possible we are no longer early. It's like when childhood ends. The comforting reality is that one is never too late and that wizards are always on time. ",60

While that may be true in some scenarios, one in which nation states destroy communication and/or energy infrastructure at scale would not be such a scenario.  But then again, all currencies would likely be impacted. 

Markets shift. Politics change. Wars start and stop. Pandemics happen.  Technology changes.  There will always be ups and downs.  The magnitude of each up and down will vary.

BTC,2024-08-04,post,Bitcoin,Recap on the state of Bitcoin and why this is the worst time to be bearish,"Quick Recap on the current State of Bitcoin 2024:

* Spot ETFs launched and Larry Fink and other mega firms are now incentivized by number go up for fee revenue. Total net inflows of ETFs so far is $17B+
* Two Presidential candidates just spoke at the Bitcoin Conference saying they would implement strategic reserves for the USA.  The freaking USA!  That alone should make you panic and start buying, because if that becomes a reality, other countries will have zero choice but to buy.  This catalyst could potentially kick off in a matter of months, don’t be too late on this.
* One of the largest wealth advisors Morgan Stanley just approved their Financial Advisors to market the Bitcoin ETFs to their High Net Worth clients.  Others will absolutely follow suit now.
* Cantor Fitzgerald says they own “a shit load” of Bitcoin.  We can’t really grasp the importance they will play in developing this market, it is very significant. Cantor Fitzgerald is one of 24 primary dealers that are authorized to trade US government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
* VanEck CEO says he has 30% of his personal funds in BTC.  So the heads of financial firms are concluding this is the best investment they can make in significant size?  Take note.
* Saylor and MicroStrategy submit for a $2B ATM, wonder what for?
* Semler Scientific announces a Bitcoin Treasury and submits an S-3 for $200M in funding to buy Bitcoin.  They will not be the last one, these will start ramping up now.
* Jamie Dimon changes his tune on Bitcoin after being a staunch detractor for years.
* Mt. Gox distributions are nearing their end.
* El Salvador continues their 1 Bitcoin per day quest.
* Banks continue to seek approval to custody and offer Bitcoin products to their clients.
* Fiat currencies globally, including those of some of the top economies in the world, continue their paths to debasement and ultimately, hyper inflation.
* The DCA crowd continues automatically stacking sats and reducing the number of Bitcoin available for purchase.  Tick tock, supply shock.
* Global M2 Money supply increasing and broke out of the current range.

But sure, let’s start getting bearish now that the number went down a bit.

We can’t possibly be bullish enough for what is on the way. The most powerful people and entities in the world have entered the game and they tend not to take losing positions. Your only job is to stack sats and sit on your hands. It’s really going to be that easy, don’t get cute now and start playing games.

HODL.

BTC,2024-11-26,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Trudeau warned us about Bitcoin losing value... tu...,"The point isn't that BTC has gone up or down, it's the fact pattern underpinning each means of exchange.

Canada prints money. All governments do. In principle, BTC/currency unit grows relative to printed fiat currencies because there are will only ever be 21,000,000 of them EVER.

Think about that. Trudeau and the banks increase Canada's M2 by like 5,5% of Canada's currency every year. Over the last 10 years, M2 has increased from 1.3T to 2.6T. Gold, which has global equilibrium will grow at 5.5% per year to capture that inflation. But BTC, which will eventually behave very boringly like gold, will grow at 5.5% PLUS the awareness/adoption premium. You will have volatility in there as people game the markets but ultimately, the only path for BTC as people become aware of it and use it (https://bitpay.com/directory/)  and government continues to devalue fiat, is up.

So while I support BTC, going back and forth between which politician is right based on what today's BTC price is  stupid and shows how little anyone actually knows about what is actually going on here.",1

> This approach has provided Bhutan with a fiscal cushion and diversified its income sources. Bhutan’s focus on sustainability has drawn international attention, as its nearly 100% hydropowered grid allows for low-carbon mining operations.

> Recently, Bhutan announced it will now hold its bitcoin reserves long-term, moving away from liquidating for government spending. As one official noted:

BTC,2025-07-11,post,Bitcoin,They called me insane at $24k. Now it’s $115k. Who’s laughing? Stay poor.,"So it finally happened. Bitcoin blasted through $115,000 last night while I was asleep on my buddy’s futon (long story—wife’s still cooling off at her sister’s place). I woke up to like seven missed calls from her. Guess she finally noticed I emptied our joint savings back when BTC was at $24k. I’m trying not to say “I told you so,” but holy shit—it feels good to be right.

Trust me, no one believed in me when I sold my business, cashed out my IRA (and my kids’ college fund), and took out a HELOC on the house to buy more sats last year. My brother literally called me insane at Christmas. Well, now my portfolio’s sitting pretty at over $12 million. Wonder how that Toyota Corolla he’s still paying off feels today.

After all the FUD, all the tears, all the sleepless nights doom-scrolling through bear market memes—this is the payoff. People on CNBC are still trying to cope, saying it’s “a bubble.” Meanwhile I’m out here tipping waitresses with $20 bills and telling them to “stay poor.” (Okay, kind of an asshole move, but after being laughed at for so long? Let me have this.)

You wouldn’t believe how many old “friends” are hitting me up out of nowhere. Suddenly my high school buddies want to talk about “how to get started in crypto.” Sorry, bro—should’ve been stacking when I was eating ramen and maxing out credit cards. Now I’m looking at private islands while they’re hoping the S&P does 8% this year.

Pretty sure my wife’s lawyer is going to have a field day with this, since technically she’s still listed on the mortgage I used to buy more BTC. But hey, divorce is temporary—Bitcoin is forever. Besides, with prices like this, I could get a new wife in Thailand.

Once this hits $250k—and it will—I’m paying off everything in cash, buying a Lambo in Bitcoin just to post the receipt on Twitter, and then moving somewhere that doesn’t tax crypto. My only regret is I didn’t take out even more leverage. Being conservative is for fiat normies.

Ordered a gold-plated hardware wallet just for kicks. If this keeps going, might get my seed phrase engraved on a platinum plaque for the man cave. Also thinking about getting a tattoo of the current ATH on my bicep so I can update it every halving. Conviction paid off, baby.

Really though, to everyone still waiting on the sidelines? Good luck. Enjoy your 3% CDs while we build generational wealth on a decentralized protocol that literally can’t stop going up. This is what happens when you bet on hard money and have the guts to hold through the pain. Stay poor, I guess.

BTC,2024-12-17,post,Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin is Useless: A Critical Look at Its True Value,"

In recent years, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity, often hailed as the future of money or even as a ""store of value"" similar to gold. However, after examining its core features and considering its broader implications, I believe Bitcoin is ultimately useless. From its divisibility to its volatility, Bitcoin fails to meet the fundamental requirements of a currency and lacks the stability that would make it a practical means of exchange or an effective store of value. Let me explain why.

1. Divisibility Doesn't Equal Scarcity

One of the primary selling points of Bitcoin is its divisibility — after all, you can break a Bitcoin down into 100 million smaller units, called satoshis. At first glance, this might seem like an advantage, but it doesn’t make Bitcoin any scarcer.

Consider the example of pizza. If you divide a pizza into more slices, the pizza doesn't become any rarer or more valuable. In fact, it’s easier for more people to have a share. Bitcoin works in the same way: while it can be divided into many smaller pieces, the fact that we can divide it doesn't change the fact that anyone with enough Bitcoin can sell it for cash. This ability to break it into fractions might seem to enhance its value, but it only creates more accessibility. Dividing a finite asset doesn’t make it more valuable; it just makes it easier to share.

2. Bitcoin’s Limited Supply Isn’t All That Special

While it’s often touted that Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins, this doesn't mean that Bitcoin is inherently scarce or valuable. The limited supply argument might have worked if Bitcoin were a tangible asset, like gold, with real-world uses. But Bitcoin, being digital, can be endlessly divided, and its value is ultimately driven by speculation, not its scarcity.

In the end, Bitcoin’s value hinges entirely on market sentiment. If people believe in its future potential, they’ll drive up the price, but if that belief falters, the price crashes. Moreover, Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its use as a stable store of value — which is a critical characteristic of any currency. A ""limited supply"" means nothing if Bitcoin's value can fluctuate wildly from day to day, as we've seen with significant price drops that reduce its purchasing power. Scarcity only drives value when there's actual demand for the asset, not when it’s treated as an investment vehicle for speculators.

3. It’s Not a Practical Medium of Exchange

In theory, Bitcoin could replace traditional currencies, but in practice, it simply isn’t useful. Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. Bitcoin’s network can only process a limited number of transactions per second, making it unsuitable for everyday use. For example, in high-demand periods, Bitcoin transaction fees can spike, and the confirmation time can be hours. You certainly wouldn’t want to use Bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee when the transaction could take several minutes or more, and you might end up paying high fees.

Furthermore, most people don't use Bitcoin to buy goods or services — they hold onto it, hoping the price will go up. In other words, people are hoarding Bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than using it for transactions. This creates a self-fulfilling cycle where Bitcoin is only valuable because people believe it will continue to rise, but it doesn’t function as a stable and reliable medium of exchange.

4. Bitcoin is Not a Hedge Against Inflation

Many advocates of Bitcoin claim it is a hedge against inflation, arguing that, like gold, it preserves purchasing power in times of economic uncertainty. But Bitcoin has not been around long enough to prove its ability to withstand inflation. In fact, Bitcoin’s price volatility makes it more susceptible to extreme fluctuations, not less.

For instance, imagine you buy 2 Bitcoin at $2 each, and then the price of goods doubles. You’d think you’ve protected yourself, but in reality, your Bitcoin might have dropped in value by 50% in the same period. The inflation of prices doesn't always correlate to the devaluation of fiat currencies; sometimes it's simply an issue of market fluctuations, which Bitcoin is not immune to.

So, how has Bitcoin truly protected anyone from inflation? The reality is that the price of Bitcoin often follows speculative bubbles, and its price can drop rapidly, eroding purchasing power in the process. Bitcoin may seem like a good hedge in theory, but in practice, it’s far from being a reliable way to protect wealth during periods of economic instability.

5. Bitcoin Is Ultimately Backed by Nothing

When people claim that Bitcoin is “backed” by its blockchain or its limited supply, they are ignoring the fact that Bitcoin is backed by nothing tangible. The U.S. dollar, despite being fiat money, is backed by the trust in the U.S. government and its economy. Bitcoin, however, has no central authority. There’s no backing, no gold reserves, no government support — it’s simply a digital asset with value driven by speculation.

The blockchain technology behind Bitcoin is certainly impressive, but it does not create intrinsic value. Bitcoin’s value is purely driven by market participants who buy into the system. Without continued demand and belief in its future, Bitcoin could easily lose its value, rendering it useless as a currency.

Conclusion

In the end, Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its novelty and speculative potential, but it doesn’t meet the basic criteria of a reliable currency or store of value. Its divisibility doesn’t make it scarce, its limited supply doesn’t create actual demand, and its volatility makes it unsuitable for daily transactions. Bitcoin is backed by nothing tangible and ultimately relies on speculation, making it a risky investment rather than a practical currency.

Until Bitcoin can evolve into something more stable and useful for everyday transactions, it remains nothing more than a digital asset subject to the whims of the market. The idea of Bitcoin as a universal currency or store of value is, in my view, a fantasy — a speculative bubble waiting to burst ",58

BTC,2024-12-17,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Why Bitcoin is Useless: A Critical Look at Its Tru...,"Nobody except you said divisibility creates scarcity. That was all you OP.  You made up an argument that no one who understands Bitcoin makes. I think this is called straw man.

Nobody who understands Bitcoin expects it to work exactly as fiat currency. It is a different form of money just as credit cards are different. Using layer 2 protocols one can easily use Bitcoin for small transactions. The are many things you can do with Bitcoin that you cannot do with gold such as store cheaply, transmit over internet and truly verify authenticity. Every form of money (cash, checks, credit cards, gold and Bitcoin) are different and each has pros and cons.

Bitcoin has not been a great hedge for inflation because it is volatile. It is volatile because market does not know how to value it yet. Shares of AMZN were also volatile in the beginning. Volatility will decrease over time. 

Bitcoin backed by nothing means the ""backer"" cannot back out of promise to redeem. The only promise is that the market decides the price and your Bitcoin cannot be diluted.

Bitcoin is not a scarce resource. It is a FINITE resource. That is even better than scarcity. Eventually gold will be mined from asteroids if its price goes high enough. But no matter how high price of Bitcoin goes, new Bitcoin are created every ten minutes regardless of hash power on the network. The algorithm ensures that. It is a promise backed by math and physics. No backer needed.",5

I will say, though, that part of the reason for the rising BTC-USD is precisely *that* it is costly to sell. Fewer sellers, higher price. 


You could make an argument that people will just *not buy* because of the tax consequences, but most people in crypto don't seem to be tax savvy, or don't mind paying 20 percent tax on their 300 percent gains. 


Furthermore, there isn't *demand* to use crypto/Bitcoin for daily purchases (coffee, in Trump's example). Even without capital gains tax complexity, businesses don't want to deal with it, and people don't want to spend it.  Those of us who have been around a long time know-- we've seen Microsoft, Tesla, and Starbucks accept crypto-- temporarily. Even with the ease of custodial Lightning, virtually no one wants to part with their Bitcoin-- not even under a ""spend-and-replace"" mentality. Gresham's law in effect.

It's a thought experiment

Just looking at this chart though, if you blindly buy whenever there's a large drawdown in retail sentiment you only have one false signal meaning the probability of this indicator alone is pretty good. People are often the most bearish around the best times to buy. That's a crazy thought being at 100K. Whenever momentum stalls retail tends to get bearish, you can see this lining up the correlations. They like buying highs and momentum and they hate buying lows

January 2023 is probably the weirdest reading on the entire chart and I can't remember what the news headlines were then but I suspect there was something

My brother is not. He once asked me ""Would there be anything that would falter your faith in BTC??""

Quantuum Computing? Possibly, but that's a way off. We are only just getting the hang of the basics, let alone programming it to crack block chains.

  
Now, onto my final point. The collapse of the global fiat financial system. At first thought, I thought this would be brilliant comedy to watch, popcorn 100%. Bitcoin would rule over all instantly...but then I thought.  
If there is no fiat to be traded with BTC, won't that make the value of BTC plummet?

You're falling for the common trap of measuring ""value"" exclusively in dollars (or whatever your everyday currency is). That's understandable since it's the unit of account used by nearly everyone in nearly every exchange for goods and services today. 

But if the government-run financial system collapses, whatever new economy emerges will find something else to use as a convenient unit of account. Maybe grams of gold or ounces of silver, maybe rounds of ammo or lithium batteries ... whatever is hard to fabricate and easy to store, transport and trade. Bitcoin *might* emerge as a leader since it fulfills all of the properties of good money, but it's far from guaranteed. If it does, its value will remain high and would potentially climb even higher. If it doesn't, maybe it goes to zero. Anything is possible.",3

Would gold and BTC rally? I don't know. Last time, a war criminal in a wheelchair enacted EO 6102 so we didn't have a functional free market for gold during the Great Depression. I assume the purchasing power of both assets would go up over time, but the initial stages would be very painful.

BTC,2025-06-15,post,Bitcoin,Biggest regret of my life,"At the age of 25, my biggest regret in life is not investing in Bitcoin before 2020, or at 50K. At 50K, it was still possible to get life-changing money from the amount I can invest.

Before 2016, I was reading news about Bitcoin and thought it's literally a steel medallion or something like that and was wondering why would anyone buy a medallion for thousands ($$$).

Even earlier, when homemade mining rigs were used by people (stacked gaming GPUs), I was wondering, why would anyone use GPUs for Bitcoin mining and what this even means instead of building a gaming PC with them.

Now, at 25, I'm daydreaming literally every second of the waking hours, what could my life be like if I invested early.

I'm from a Bulgarian province and the feeling is demoralizing as hell. Holes on the asphalt, tree roots pushing roads upwards, deteriorating ""commie"" blocks, an underpaid and exploitative job I can barely tolerate, relatives who don't understand my pain, you know...

I wish I learned what Bitcoin actually is and then used my GPUs to mine it instead of running Counter-Strike, Call of Duty and Minecraft 24/7 and, in addition to this, giving my parents' hard-earned money to Gabe Newell for free.

All my problems in life, both social and financial, stem from the fact I didn't invest in Bitcoin. This is the conclusion I made after spending a long time thinking what I did wrong and how I ended up like that.",778

BTC,2025-05-29,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: How does Bitcoin obtain and hold value? Entirely t...,"The value of a monetary good stems from its monetary properties. Bitcoin's value comes from its strong monetary properties. The U.S. Dollar holds value today, obviously, and that is because of its monetary properties (which may be unpopular to state here).

The principal monetary properties are (from Andy Edstrom's book *Why Buy Bitcoin*): identifiable, transferable, durable, divisible, dense, scarce, long term stable value (or I would say store of value), short term stable value, fungible, unseizable, censorship resistant, private, required for an important purpose, and backed by a powerful agent. 

Bitcoin (or bitcoin on the secondary layers) is **very** strong in most of these monetary properties. It is currently not strong on short-term stable value. Bitcoin has a slowly increasing supply that is fixed at 21 million bitcoin. The supply will not rise to meet demand, which causes some volatility. More volatility comes from the adoption waves. Few people hold bitcoin now. As millions more people buy it, the number of users increases dramatically. Eventually, most of the world will hold bitcoin, and adoption will necessarily slow, as we run out of people. Then, the volatility will decrease to a manageable level. We have already seen the volatility in the price go down substantially as the number of users went from next to nothing to somewhere around 100 million. It will continue to go down as we go to billions of users.",2

BTC,2024-08-17,comment,Bitcoin,"Comment on: JEFF BOOTH: ""It doesn't matter if the existing sys...","Deflation is actually the natural and healthy state of an economy:

Productivity increases over time, so supply of goods increases relative to constant money supply, and prices naturally drop. This has several obvious benefits:

1: Real interest rates will naturally be low—maybe even negative—which enables plentiful growth capital (which fuels production which fuels more deflation)

2: Real quality of living increases for all—as the purchasing power of savings increases for all.

3: Saving and investment is rewarded versus consumption, which further fuels investment in the future and improved productivity.

We have already had this phenomenon in electronics/computers/software, where the pace of innovation exceeded the pace of money printing, reducing prices and creating enormous benefits for everyone.

TVs and such are cheaper but inflation thanks to money printing has inflated other goods & services

Jeff Booth has this saying: “Abundance in money creates scarcity everywhere else, scarcity in money creates abundance everywhere else.”

Inflation is just an idea and clearly it doesn’t work, there’s no universal law stating money supply has to grow forever & not aligning with Mother Nature has had it’s consequences",38

Uganda’s **2022** announcement of discovering 31 million tonnes of gold ore was widely reported, but the figures warrant scrutiny. The claim included an estimate of 320,158 tonnes of refined gold, valued at approximately $12.8 trillion. However, this estimate appears to be significantly inflated.

For context, the World Gold Council notes that a high-quality gold mine typically yields 8 to 10 grams of gold per tonne of ore, while lower-grade mines yield 1 to 4 grams per tonne. Applying an average yield of 7 grams per tonne to Uganda’s 31 million tonnes of ore would result in approximately 217 tonnes of refined gold, not 320,158 tonnes. This discrepancy suggests that the initial estimates may have been overly optimistic.

The global total of mined gold throughout history is estimated at around 244,000 tonnes. If Uganda’s claim of 320,158 tonnes were accurate, it would surpass the total global historical production, which is highly improbable.

  
Uganda discovered **31 million metric tonnes of gold ore**, *not* refined gold. Gold ore is rock that contains traces of gold. Even high-grade ore rarely exceeds **10 g/tonne**.

* Assume an optimistic **7g/tonne yield**.
* 31,000,000 tonnes × 7g = **217,000,000 grams** = **217 tonnes of gold**.
* At $2,400/oz, that’s worth $16.7 billion, *not* $12 trillion.

  
The price of gold isn’t driven by how much *might* exist in the ground—it’s driven by:

* How much is **economically recoverable**.
* The **rate** at which it’s mined.
* **Market demand**, central banks, inflation hedges, etc.

Gold mining takes **years of infrastructure** and **billions in investment**. Even if Uganda’s figures were correct, it would **barely move the needle** for the foreseeable future.

BTC,2025-03-20,post,Bitcoin,Bitcoin itself has no value,"It's true. On it's own, Bitcoin is completely useless and has no real value.

**All networks are useless without people who gain value from them.**

Imagine if no one used the internet. You can't, can you? That's because it basically supports our society at this point. But when it very first was invented, people had a hard time conceptualizing how it would help them personally.

Now it's very apparent. It enhances our lives in many ways and will continue to.

Bitcoin is no different. The less you understand the many, many problems that Bitcoin fixes, the less you will see the ""value"" in what Bitcoin is doing, and will continue to do for decades to come.

Unlike the internet though, once you understand why Bitcoin will thrive for decades to come, you can actually own it while it grows. Bitcoin's network is currently valued in the market at around $86k a coin.

We could make another 100 Bitcoin networks if we wanted to. All 100 would fail just like if you made another 100 internets right now.

So, the next time someone says ""Bitcoin has no value"", tell them that technically they used to be right. That assertion is no more than *denial* today, though, as far as the market is concerned.

Some good reading that will help depict why the Bitcoin network will be worth many many trillions of dollars in the future if it stays decentralized and secure:

3. A sudden sharp drop in price could force liquidation and loss of funds.

Having said all that, I’m not actually against the idea of getting debt to fund more purchases, I do it myself.

Smart people will accumulate Bitcoin, then borrow against it. To do it today you'd need a loan-to-value ratio of at least 50% in case of a big drawdown. But in the future when the price stabilises you'll probably get away with 70-80% LTV.

You'll probably get cheaper interest rates by depositing your collateral with your local bank, but services will be available for people who want shared custody solutions, where the lender (a bank) and borrower trust two external parties (an insurance company and a technical middleware provider) with keys in a 3 of 4 multi-sig.

This movement up would cause other short positions to get taken out, causing a cascade of movement. This is what a stop run is. 

We want people taking the other side (short in this case). If everyone is already allocated long, there’s no more fuel for upside and the only path is back down.

Many people misunderstand the ratio of Long:Short as being Buys:Sells. In fact it’s just the number of orders but the sum is equal. 

So if you want to long/Buy then there must be someone who is Short/sell. 

Let’s take a look at the explanation of coinglass:

What is the Bitcoin  long/short ratio and Cryptocurrency Longs vs Shorts?

First, it’s important to understand that the long positions and short positions on all exchanges are equal, maintaining a 1:1 ratio.

BTC,2024-09-14,post,Bitcoin,"If bitcoin is the digital gold, then bitcoin is wildly undervalued. See analysis below. ","Bitcoin is often compared to gold and as such I wanted to compare the values of bitcoin to existing mined gold. This is not meant to be a 1 to 1 comparison but simply a data point. 
Gold is currently ~$2,600/ounce.
It's estimated that there's 244,000 tons of mined gold in existence. 

Each ton is 32,000 ounces. 
So 32,000 x 244,000 x $2,600 is $20.3008 trillion 
If the total amount of bitcoin is 21 million, then  would mean each bitcoin is worth $966,704. 

Obviously this would mean a full transition of gold to bitcoin which is unrealistic but even if people continued to slowly migrate from gold to bitcoin with a 10% allocation then value would still be ~$96,000. 

If we take into Acct the estimate that 20% of all bitcoin burned then the value is $1.2m

My take from this is that there's additional upward potential. Especially if we get a major country central bank that starts to hold bitcoin.

BTC,2024-09-14,comment,Bitcoin,"Comment on: If bitcoin is the digital gold, then bitcoin is wi...","It’s really, really simple: 

Either Bitcoin is ‘hard money’ thus a store of value and ‘digital gold’, or it isn’t. 

If isn’t, then the price will begin to stagnate. It doesn’t even need to fall. It could simply stay at $100k or so for years meaning it has failed. If Bitcoin can’t even outpace inflation then it is not a store of value. 

If it is, then it is reasonable to expect it to match at least half of gold’s market cap in the next 10 years or so. 

Meaning it ‘should’ be around $10tn by that time thus approximately $500k per Bitcoin. 

And if Michael Saylor’s base case of $13m by 2045 has any hope of becoming true, then it’ll be a hell of a lot higher than that. 

The key signs to look out for are adoption, number of non zero addresses, the hash rate, worldwide sentiment, and of course the USD price. 

In respect of price, our best indicator is the 4 year cycle. If it repeats again, then Bitcoin should be exponentially higher one year from now than it is today. 

If however we top out at say $150k and then dump 50%, be very afraid. A $75k Bitcoin in 2026 has failed.",1

So IMHO, I think some countries will add BTC to their treasuries like the US plans to, a few may even BACK their fiat (making it fiat no more) with BTC on a small scale, and then a few like Suriname will simply discard their own failed country and push BTC as transactional currency in its' place. (Rare, but more popular as time goes by.)

The treasury-adders like USA, Bhutan, and El Salvador are going to do alright but delay BTC adoption as a transactional currency in their countries. Their wealth will go up but not the fastest. 

The fiat-killers (BTC-backing) are going to do the best as their sovereign money is going to go up in price as fast as Bitcoin does, so those nations will become super powerful pretty quickly. (Except in bear market years.) They will perform on FOREX markets like Microstrategy is performing. (!)

Those that are in the 3rd category have the option to trade their fiat for bitcoins on the way out... (making the government rich at the expense of the people.) I don't know how I feel about this yet since it forces their population to switch to BTC the hard way, as their existing fiat crumbles into hyperinflation. Kinda scary on the ground, I'd think. Maybe they can coordinate a national switch-over day at some point.

BTC,2025-06-17,post,Bitcoin,Does investing in Bitcoin only to make profit actually hurt its real value?,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I’d love to hear what the community thinks.

Bitcoin was originally created as a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency — a way to opt out of the traditional financial system and store value in a trustless, censorship-resistant network. But today, it feels like the dominant narrative is “buy low, sell high” — people treating it like a stock or asset to flip for profit.

Doesn’t this mindset kind of go against what gives Bitcoin its real value?

If the majority of users are just holding until they can cash out in fiat at a higher price, doesn’t that reduce Bitcoin to nothing more than a speculative vehicle? And doesn’t that ultimately weaken its long-term utility as an alternative monetary system?

Curious if others here think this focus on profit-taking undermines Bitcoin’s potential — or is it just a natural part of adoption?",1

I had a perfectly open solid financial marriage, both of us earning about the same. In 2020, I got interested and decided to start buying Bitcoin from our mutual stash, with her reluctant agreement.

I just told her no every time because I could see the future, she declared me some sort of mentally unstable cultist, long story short now I'm single. In the 50/50 division, she got the stocks and the gold, I took the Bitcoin.

I'm in a better place now.

What makes Bitcoin a better investment choice than an asset that actually produces something?  As a store of value, I also take objection. Its history to date has shown that it’s NOT a good store of value as tomorrow it might be worth half what I paid for it. For a non producing asset to increase in value that assets demand must increase. So, the argument seems to be that demand for Bitcoin will always increase because all alternative investments will be unable to match its ability to both store value and appreciate over time.  Is that about right?
I don’t disagree that fiat currency is a BAD investment.  Holding dollars long term is a guaranteed loser. I also agree that Bitcoin will benefit from being first.  What I want to know is why invest in Bitcoin over other assets?",0
BTC,2024-12-01,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Why Bitcoin over other more easily valued assets?...,"Your skepticism is valid and reflects critical questions about Bitcoin’s role as an investment and store of value.

BTC vs GOLD. Here's why bitcoin MAY BE better:   
\- scarcity and predictability (btc is capped while gold's supply is tied to it's extraction)  
\- portability and divisibility (btc can be transacted globally in seconds and divided into small fractions called satoshis, with gold it's not so easy obviously)  
\- digital utility (it kinda aligns with a world moving towards digitization)  
\- emerging adoption (it continues being recognized as an asset by institutions and NATIONS) 

While btc is not directly comparable to productive assets it serves it's purpose well as it's primarily a hedge against fiat debasement offering digital, deflationary, border-less alternative.  if you really want to weight BTC against other assets the question for you should be ""do you value diversification, censorship resistance and the potential for future adoption over traditional cash flow-generating investments?"" only you can answer that question and it should guide you with your future decisions, really.

Good luck mate.",5

Bitcoin is the fix for that mistake, and although I can't look into the future I'm pretty convinced will stay longer thsn fiat has.

Don’t feel pressured to invest. The growth phase cannot last forever and it will be a very bumpy ride.

BTC,2025-01-25,post,Bitcoin,Sold all my BTC,"Just wanted to share my BTC journey and my reasons for pausing

Back in July I bought 2800$ in bitcoin that was being put aside for tax time. My reasoning for that was to hedge $CAD inflation and maybe make a little extra. Since then its been sitting with 100$ thrown in here and there and today I make the regrettable but responsible decision to sell at 80% profit totalling 6500$. I hate selling as I know BTC is only going up in price but I will be able to pay the remaining 3200$ I owe on a 27% APR car loan. 

No more stress about a 200$ bi weekly car payment means I can allocate the 200$ into buying more bitcoin and with time my BTC reserve will sit above 6000$+, hedge CAD$ devaluation with no pressure to sell it. Thank you for reading. Taking profit is good and all but It cannot be enjoyed if I owe that amount with a 27% interest rate.

The company that printed the cards bought out the **M**agic **t**he **G**athering **O**nline **X**change, and did not worry too much about security since they could run the printing presses to get BTC.

Blockchain experts and online exchange software gurus observed that BTC readily translated to hard currency, flocked to the concept, and startups doing demonstrations bid up the price to hundreds of dollars, peaking around $1000 before MtG.O.X. crashed and burned.  The company found bad security left it short BTC, and it could not print its way out.  This should be recognized as the first BTC short squeeze.

BTC,2025-04-21,post,Bitcoin,I made 11x on Bitcoin and still feel like an idiot,"Between 2013 and 2020, I bought and sold 19 BTC. I made around $80K off a $7K investment which helped with the down payment on our first house. Should feel great, right? Not exactly. Every time BTC pumps I tell my wife about what could have been. In her words, “Bitcoin is the worst thing that’s happened to our relationship.” 

So I dug into this feeling and here's where I landed: Bitcoin regret isn’t just common, it’s *inevitable*. Bitcoin is a currency so its usefulness depends on circulation. Unlike stocks, its value *requires* people to sell. If no one had bought that pizza with it, or sold when it hit $1K, or cashed out in 2017... BTC wouldn’t be what it is today. But that also means regret is baked into its DNA.

I even made a new metric for it: the Bitcoin Regret Index. Basically I went back to 2014 (earliest available data) and calculated all the missed profits from sales. As of about a month ago, that index is at 172. That means for every $1 of Bitcoin wealth that exists today, there’s $172 of ""what if"" gains from people who sold too early. Total theoretical regret? $272 trillion.

The TL;DR: Bitcoin is a regret machine. People have to sell for it to have any value. The price is powered by stories like mine. And maybe yours too.

It’s a reminder that while Bitcoin holds immense potential, sometimes the best investment is in our personal lives and well-being.

BTC,2025-06-08,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Bitcoin as a store of value or medium of exchange?...,"Bitcoin is money or more accurately becoming money. There are three major components of money. A store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. There are many types of currencies/money that have some characteristics of money or they are better at some characteristics than others. The dollar is often held as the best money currently. It has a huge network effect by being the world reserve currency so it is the best medium of exchange. It’s the best store of value compared to other currencies but not a great store of value compared to other assets since it’s lost 98% of its value over the past 1 human lifetime. And it’s a great unit of account. All other fiat currencies are ok medium of exchanges at least in their own jurisdiction, are terrible stores of value, and ok unit of accounts. Bitcoin is a new money. It is a great store of value, not a great medium of exchange (yet), and not used as a unit of account at all.

But looking back in history, most moneys (at least commodity monies) start out this way. They are held for its store of value properties. As more people hold it to store value, the network grows, and more people are willing to accept it as a medium of exchange, and lastly once it’s used often as a medium of exchange people begin pricing goods in services in that currency. It doesn’t happen all at once. First people must save in it, then when the market is saturated people begin spending it, lastly people pricing in it.

Put another way, as long as you have a good money that appreciates in value and a bad money that depreciates in value, the spender will always prefer to spend the depreciating currency first (dollars) and save the appreciating currency (bitcoin). This is called greshams law. This continues until more and more people hold bitcoin and want to get rid of dollars before they lose value. At some point when both currencies have matured, people begin to stop wanting the depreciating asset for their goods and services and only demand the good money. That’s when bitcoin really becomes a medium of exchange. And that probably won’t happen for decades when bitcoin is many decades old and the dollar depreciates another 50%.",2

BTC,2024-12-05,post,Bitcoin,"""In a world where Bitcoin keeps increasing in value, no-one is going to spend it"" - yes they will. Let me explain why.","**For those new to Bitcoin:**

# Have you ever wondered why your parents could buy a house and a car on one salary, but today we're all grinding just to keep up? 

Spoiler alert: it's not because stuff is actually getting more expensive—it's because our money is broken. 

Bitcoin fixes this.

**The Illusion of Expensive Stuff**

Technology is making everything more efficient. Think about it: producing goods is cheaper and faster than ever before. The natural order should be that prices *drop* over time. But thanks to money printing and inflation, we're stuck in a world where prices *seem* to rise. It's like running on a treadmill that's speeding up—you have to work harder just to stay in the same place.

**Bitcoin Flips the Script**

Bitcoin is deflationary by design. There's a capped supply, so it can't be devalued by printing more. When Bitcoin underpins the economy, it aligns with the natural order—stuff gets cheaper over time because your money holds its value (or even appreciates). That's not (only) because bitcoin is ""increasing in value"", rather, Bitcoin represents the true order of things. When our protocol for ""value"" is not expanding; you notice how the world is actually prosperous. Less ""stuff"" automatically funnels to the richest class just because they hold ""stuff"" (equities, homes, etc.) already.

**Housing: From Asset to Shelter**

For instance; have you ever thought about why houses are so expensive? It's not *just* demand; it's because people use real estate as a store of value to hedge against inflation. With Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, there's less incentive to park wealth in houses. This could *demonetize* housing, stripping away the investment premium and making homes more affordable for everyone.

**Better Savings for All**

When your money appreciates over time, saving becomes rewarding—not just for the rich but for everyone. You don't need complex investment strategies to preserve wealth. This encourages responsible spending and reduces unnecessary consumption driven by the fear of money losing value.

**Global Settlement and Fair Play**

Bitcoin as the default value-storing unit levels the playing field. International settlements become straightforward, transparent, and fair. No more currency manipulations or unfair advantages. Everyone operates with the same rules, benefiting global trade and cooperation.

**But Won't People Stop Spending?**

Not really. People still need to live, enjoy experiences, and buy stuff. I just bought a car half a year ago, for instance, knowing full and well that that money would have appreciated had I put it in Bitcoin—or stocks— instead. The key is that spending becomes more intentional. Instead of splurging because money is losing value, purchases are made based on actual need and desire. Plus, an appreciating currency doesn't halt spending—it just curbs wasteful consumption. In most cases, this is actually good for our planet as well.

So, in a nutshell: Bitcoin realigns the economy with the natural progression of technology and efficiency. Prices should fall; therefore savings should grow, and everyone gets a fair shot at prosperity. Whether you're born in Manhattan or Zanzibar.

Personally, I'm ready for a world where my money works *for* me, and not against me.

We have all lived through decades of deflationary goods experience in the form of electronics and computers. You don't need decades, teens have seen it.

And yet we all line up to buy the new gadget knowing another one will come out in a year or less and be better in every measure and (usually) cheaper.

But I also spent two whole bitcoins years ago to pay for my daughter’s university, and at other times when I was broke.

BTC,2024-12-05,comment,Bitcoin,"Comment on: ""In a world where Bitcoin keeps increasing in valu...","BTC won’t replace fiat. BTC will anchor fiat in reality. 

Property is the originally deflationary asset but it isn’t fungible and is dependent on local markets. 

Property didn’t replace fiat. BTC won’t either.

What BTC will do is hold the money printers accountable because everyone will be able to store value (the barrier to entry is smaller). When the government prints money each of those dollars will have to provide extra value or everyone will just buy BTC. The rich already do this with property but the poor are excluded because the barrier to entry. 

Let’s take this to an extreme; the government print money to buy BTC. Everyone would buy BTC because money would go to zero and BTC would go to the moon.

Now let’s say the government prints money to invest in infrastructure that makes the economy more efficient. The dollar is more valuable because it’s buying power, BTC stays the same price in USD and can buy more but is less liquid so marginally less valuable.

At some point in the future governments will probably compete with BTC by making positive ROI investments and then burning tax dollars.

This is kinda crazy.",5
BTC,2024-12-05,comment,Bitcoin,"Comment on: ""In a world where Bitcoin keeps increasing in valu...","„No one will spend money anymore because the money gets more valuable if you wait.“

What do those people think? That everyone will be a starving millionaire?

Also: if no one spends money and the economy does a nosedive, then money will become worth LESS, because the economy it represents shrinks. If that happens people have an incentive again to spend/invest money until the economy grows and money is deflationary again. It’s a pretty self-regulating system that doesn’t require central intervention to „stimulate growth“, that finally is just artificial growth for growth‘s sake with all its unintended consequences (resource exploitation, growth of wealth gap, financialisation of stuff like housing or scarce resources and food).",3

When it comes to fiat - if you are going to pump new money into the system regularly, make sure wealth distribution is sustainable, and I think this is one of the things with which fiat money went really really wrong.

BTC,2025-06-15,post,Bitcoin,Will corporate debt result in liquidation disaster for BTC?,"Hey everyone, total noob question here, but I keep seeing news about companies taking on debt (mostly convertible bonds) to buy a ton of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin suddenly crashes, do these companies just get liquidated? Like, are they forced to sell their Bitcoin at a loss because of the debt? And if that happens, wouldn't it make Bitcoin's price drop a ton?",36
BTC,2025-06-15,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Will corporate debt result in liquidation disaster...,"If they're smart and structure their debt intelligently, then the chance of liquidation/having to sell their BTC is actually v low. Most impact will likely be on their share prices, not on BTC's price, though BTC could see lower demand from their impacted buying during a severe bear market. ",16
BTC,2025-06-15,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Will corporate debt result in liquidation disaster...,"Not as likely as it may seem. A lot of these offerings like microstrategy's don't have to pay interest until the notes mature if they even mature. They call them cumulative interest, meaning they don't even have to pay interest until some condition is met. They can also be perpetual, meaning they don't have to ever pay back the note. Frankly these are terrible offerings for the investor, they should just buy BTC, they will make more money with less risk.",9
BTC,2025-06-15,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Will corporate debt result in liquidation disaster...,"Some companies will pay the interest out of free cash flow. The bonds are effectively low-interest loans to accumulate more bitcoin than they could get out of simply buying with free cash flow today. 

It’s mostly convertible bonds which can be converted to shares in the company at some agreed $ per share value rather than repaying the principal (and possibly the interest too if they have bundled the repayment to “at maturity”). 

Assuming they did not / could not repay the loan principal and/or interest at maturity this would only dilute the company shares - affecting the company’s share price - but not force any sale of Bitcoin.

If this strategy (continues to) works well for the initial companies doing it this will drive more corporate adoption (driving Bitcoin demand).",6
BTC,2025-06-15,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Will corporate debt result in liquidation disaster...,"You'd have to look at each company's position. From my casual reading most seem to have placed 3-5% of their Treasuries into Bitcoin.  It's diversification for most, although some do look as if they might be going balls-to-wall.   They'd also be well aware of risk and  presumably have some hedge strategy in place, keeping an eye on the debt due.  Top and 1st paragraph headlines are not enough to go on, you'd really need to look more deeply at each one as they aren't all structured the same. Many recent announcements are not fait accompli purchases at all - they are announcements of permission/intent to pursue within parameters.",4

So they can collectively buy billions in bitcoins and it won’t move the needle. But once the OTC supply is gone. Then the only way to get bitcoin is through exchanges.

1. Max Supply of Bitcoin
	•	Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins.
	•	This is the absolute maximum that will ever exist.

⸻

2. Projected Minted Bitcoins by 2045
	•	As of 2025: around 19.7 million BTC already mined.
	•	By 2045, after multiple halvings, about 20.9 million BTC will exist.

⸻

3. Subtract Lost Coins
	•	It’s estimated that 3 to 4 million BTC are permanently lost (forgotten keys, dead wallets, etc.).
	•	Let’s go with 3.5 million lost BTC.

20.9 million - 3.5 million = 17.4 million BTC effectively existing

⸻

4. Estimate Tradable Supply (Liquid Coins)

Most Bitcoin is HODLed, locked in cold wallets, or sitting in ETFs/institutional custody.
	•	In 2025, only ~2 million BTC are actually liquid on exchanges.
	•	This number is shrinking over time.

Let’s say that by 2045, only 750,000 BTC are realistically available on the open market.

⸻

5. Hypothetical Market Cap Scenario

Assume Bitcoin becomes a dominant global store of value, replacing parts of:
	•	Gold
	•	Real estate
	•	Bonds
	•	Fiat savings
	•	Corporate treasuries

Say the total Bitcoin market cap hits $17.25 trillion by 2045.

6. Final Price Per Coin Calculation

BTC,2025-03-15,post,Bitcoin,"Josh Mandell’s prediction of the fourth turning, what is the 4th turning and what does Bitcoin have to do with it?","There is a book called the 4th turning published in 1997. 

It discusses first, second, third and fourth turnings in American history. 

The Crisis (Fourth Turning) is a period of upheaval, where institutions collapse, and society undergoes major transformation, often triggered by wars, economic collapse, or revolutions. This is where the authors argue America is now (starting in 2008 with the financial crisis). It’s a time of struggle that eventually leads to the rebuilding of institutions and a new High.

Where Are We Now?

If the theory holds, we are currently in the middle of the Fourth Turning, which is expected to last until the early 2030s. According to Strauss and Howe, this phase typically brings major conflicts (economic, political, or military), followed by the emergence of a new social order.

The book is often cited in discussions about current events, including economic instability, political division, and global tensions, suggesting that we are in the midst of a defining moment in American history.

In past Fourth Turnings, financial systems have been restructured like the gold standard changes in the 1930s and 1970s. Bitcoin could be a part of the next monetary reset.

Bitcoins role

Bitcoin aligns with the historical patterns of the Fourth Turning challenging the old system, thriving during economic chaos, and potentially becoming part of the new order. Whether it emerges as the “
new gold or something bigger depends on how this Turning plays out.

Do you see Bitcoin as a hedge for personal wealth during this crisis, or as something even bigger—like a foundation for a new financial system?",22

I agree with this, sort of. All us plebs who got in early will benefit massively. At this very moment a bunch of fiat-rich people are/soon will be piling in; they will benefit greatly too. Stubborn rich people who delay will become merely middle class, and the vast majority of plebs will be left behind in the dust.


Some will argue they deserve it, some will not.


But, once we transition to a Bitcoin standard (which will cause a great wealth transfer during the transition),  we will at least be playing a fair game. That is to say, the rules of the game will be fair, but we will all be starting at different points.


It's not going to be nice for a lot of people, but all we can do as individuals is trying to secure the best starting point for ourselves, and anyone close to us who cares to listen.

BTC,2025-07-12,post,Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin fundamentally priced based on energy or market value? Had an interesting debate with a friend.,"Last night I had a deep conversation with a friend about what fundamentally gives Bitcoin its value. I argued that Bitcoin's price is directly tied to the cost of energy—since mining requires energy, and that energy cost sets a kind of floor for the value. In other words, energy is the base layer that gives Bitcoin its ""weight"" in the economy.

My friend disagreed. His take was that Bitcoin gets its price purely from market dynamics—supply, demand, and the collective belief in its decentralized nature. He’s made a fair bit of money trading crypto, so he’s coming at it more from the market psychology angle, while I come more from the technical/IT side.

To be clear: I fully agree that market dynamics determine the *actual* price of Bitcoin at any given time. Prices fluctuate due to speculation, news, halving cycles, regulation, etc. But my point was more fundamental — that energy cost underpins the whole thing. It sets a lower bound and provides a kind of ""gravitational pull"" to the price. If mining becomes more expensive due to energy costs, unprofitable miners drop out, supply tightens, and pressure builds upward — and vice versa.

I gave him a thought experiment:  
Imagine an alien civilization comes to Earth and can mine Bitcoin at zero cost (e.g., they have free, limitless energy and better mining tech). They start flooding the market with newly mined BTC. Wouldn't the price of Bitcoin drop, since the cost basis of production is now zero for a massive new supplier?

His response was that due to the sheer volume and liquidity of the Bitcoin market, this alien supply wouldn’t significantly impact the price—at least not in the short term. He believed the market wouldn't ""notice"" unless the volume was truly overwhelming.

Another response was that the Bitcoin network adjusts difficulty automatically. So if mining becomes easier due to better tech, the protocol would just make it harder again — meaning the system would adapt. While I agree that’s true, **my point wasn't about mining hardware or hashrate or difficulty adjustment — it was about the** ***cost of energy***\*\*,\*\* which is a separate and *fundamental* factor.

We eventually agreed to disagree, realizing neither of us could fully convince the other.

So now I’m curious:  
**Do you think Bitcoin derives its value from the cost of energy (proof-of-work), or is it purely market-driven? Or both? How would a zero-cost producer affect the price?**

Would love to hear how others see this—especially people from both tech and finance/trading backgrounds.

edit:  
I see now - mining cost actually **follows** Bitcoin’s market price, not the other way around. Miners only spend what they expect to earn. When the price goes up, mining expands; when it drops, miners pull back. The system self-regulates through the difficulty adjustment.

My mistake was thinking about mining as a **single machine** with a fixed cost, rather than as a **competitive global network** that scales up or down collectively. Here's a clearer step-by-step of how it works:

1. **Mining becomes cheaper** Electricity costs drop → miners can mine more cheaply. 
2. **More miners join or expand** Cheaper mining = higher profits → more competition. 
3. **Difficulty increases** More miners = blocks come faster → protocol increases difficulty. Network now uses **more energy per block**. **Cost per BTC mined doesn't drop**, because extra energy use cancels out the savings.
4. **Profit margins shrink again** With higher difficulty and more energy used, profits return to normal. 
5. **Bitcoin remains energy-backed** Even with cheaper energy, Bitcoin still requires **real-world work** to mine. If energy becomes *too* cheap, the “weight” behind each coin may feel weaker. **BTC price (long-term):** Depends on demand and belief in Bitcoin’s enforced scarcity.",3

High/Low electricity price will affect mining profitability at a given difficulty target, but as miners join or drop out the difficulty target will just adjust to keep the blocks coming at the right rate.  

If electricity got really expensive, or bitcoin price crashed... the whole network could still run with a few guys doing solo mining on usb-miners... just the difficulty target would be low.

Budget to pay for electricity is defined by price, it follows price. Price of energy doesn't matter at all because mining is zero sum game with difficulty adjustment and absolute amount of power (Watts) doesn't matter at all

Then the next layer of thinking is where bitcoin demand comes from? That's where the scarcity and fixed supply and the fairness miming lead to justifying the demand

The only exception has been the year of 2009, satoshi put initial difficulty too high so the production cost of bitcoin until the end of 2009 was above the market price so it wasn't worth it to mine bitcoin.

M2 supply, adoption, fear. Both things are constants, people will forver be mining bitcoin. Demand will always increase while supply drops. Btc mining will stop when there is no value to Bitcoin.

BTC,2025-07-12,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is Bitcoin fundamentally priced based on energy or...,">If mining becomes more expensive due to energy costs, unprofitable miners drop out, supply tightens, and pressure builds upward 

actually no, you need to learn about difficulty adjustments. Each time unprofitable miners drop out, the hash rate lowers, thus after 2 weeks the difficulty is reduced, and profitable miners get lower energy costs.

If you look at the development of the hashrate over the last 16 years, more often to opposite happened: new hardware made mining more efficient, the hashrate increased, and after 2 weeks, the difficulty went up.

The only thing affecting the supply of newly mined coins are the halvings. We will always get new blocks on average every 10 minutes, but the block reward has been halved in 2012, in 2016, in 2020 and in 2024.",1

The main confusion to me was if energy prices drop, a miner will spend less energy, thus be able to sell it's mined BTC for cheaper and thus lowering the price of bitcoin. But the thing is that you can't see it as a singular miner, it's a network. Cheaper energy prices will result in more miners joining the network, effectively cancelling out the singular cheap miner. Basically, cost of more cheap miners = cost of less expensive miners.",2
BTC,2025-07-12,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is Bitcoin fundamentally priced based on energy or...,"How does the ""network effect"" specifically define the value of bitcoin?

I understand Metcalf's law, but this originally related to telephone networks where a value could be placed on the calls between two individuals, then when people are added the connections increase by n(n-1), so increasing the network value to more than the number of people.

How does this translate to bitcoin?",2
BTC,2025-07-12,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is Bitcoin fundamentally priced based on energy or...,"I don't think that BTCs value is fundamentally rooted in the network effect, it's network effect supports its robustness and security.

BTC,2025-07-12,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Is Bitcoin fundamentally priced based on energy or...,"I see where you're coming from, but I’d argue that while demand sets the price in the short term, the cost of production (specifically the energy spent) still plays a foundational role. Proof-of-work ties Bitcoin to real-world physics, and that costliness isn’t just incidental; it’s what gives Bitcoin *economic weight* and makes its scarcity credible.

The fact that miners adjust their budget based on price doesn’t make energy irrelevant, it just shows that the system balances around that cost. Without that energy expenditure, Bitcoin would lose its unforgeable costliness. Even if price leads cost in a dynamic way, the underlying *anchor* is still energy.",1

BTC,2024-10-29,post,Bitcoin,It’s Not About One Bitcoin – It’s About the Value You Store,"
I often hear people talk about how they “missed the boat” on Bitcoin, wishing they’d bought sooner or lamenting that they may never own a whole coin. But here’s the thing: if Bitcoin is truly a store of value, it doesn’t actually matter when you bought or how much you own.

Think of it this way: if you do a certain amount of work, and that work has a value X, you’re simply translating X into Bitcoin. Even if you receive fewer satoshis now than you might have in the past, you’re still storing the same amount of value — the X amount of work. This X amount of work, or value, will appreciate at the same rate as any Bitcoin that was stored earlier.

Sure, owning a full Bitcoin is great, but whether you have a whole coin, a fraction, or just a few satoshis, your value appreciates right alongside everyone else’s. It’s about storing value, not hitting an arbitrary number of Bitcoin.

BTC,2025-05-28,post,Bitcoin,Change My Mind: Bitcoin represents the purest form of property rights in the 21st century - legal analysis,"I've been studying the legality of blockchain technology for 8 years now.

One perspective I don't see discussed much elsewhere: Bitcoin might actually represent the most complete expression of property rights we have in the modern world.

# Property Rights

When speaking of ownership, we often speak as if we own an asset.

Let's say a piece of land.

However, we generally do not own actual physical objects. We own a right. Nothing can be owned except a right.

The essence of such rights lies mainly in the legal power of excluding others from interfering with the enjoyment of the property.

Historically, property rights included the right to freely possess, enjoy, and dispose of property.

The rights and duties associated with a property are usually determined by the laws of the state it is located.

Moreover, the right of the owner of a thing may be all but eaten up by the dominant rights of tenants, banks, and other claims. In such cases, ownership may be reduced to a mere name rather than a reality.

# Traditional Financial Assets

When you look at traditional financial assets - stocks, bonds, even bank deposits - you don't truly own them.

You own a claim. One depending on complex legal frameworks.

For example, if you buy stocks in an American company through a broker you hold limited economic rights (like dividends) or certain ownership rights (like voting), but all the other property rights are distributed across a web of financial institutions acting as intermediaries.

You also can't freely possess, transfer, or dispose of these property rights unless going through regulated gatekeepers.

# Bitcoin's Property Revolution

Bitcoin flips this entirely.

When you hold Bitcoin, you possess a digital asset with no legal risk at its core.

It offers full autonomy over holdings and transactions without regulated intermediaries or counterparty risk.

Bitcoin exists as pure property secured by math rather than legal frameworks.

Moreover, your ability to enjoy your rights does not depend on guarantees or laws of any single jurisdiction.

The only thing that comes close is gold or silver bullion held in your hand.

But those you cannot dispose of over distance without using an intermediary (introducing legal complexity).

# Tldr:

The property rights in traditional financial assets depend on complex legal frameworks. Bitcoin is the only assets existing independent of this.",70

If I buy Bitcoin and store it in a paper wallet, but then someone steals that private key, they have violated my right, though neither of us has possession. It’s just information which can be duplicated, unlike the apple. I, they, or anyone with the private key can create a transaction - but if anything “possesses” the Bitcoin, it’s the blockchain, not us. Is it even property?

BTC,2025-05-28,comment,Bitcoin,Comment on: Change My Mind: Bitcoin represents the purest form...,"You raise pretty good points, which I surely do not have a definitive answer to. It is an old discussion as well. In classical liberalism, the idea was that one of the main goals of forming the State was to turn possessions into property. Without rules stipulating who owns what, anyone could simply take possession away by force and thus take away ownership. Only the law could prevent this. Bitcoin replaces certain of these characteristics with code, although we still need protection from $5 wrench attacks.

The next point: can digital assets attract property rights? This was actually a problem the Mt. Gox proceedings ran into. Bitcoins are intangible, and Japanese law restricts ownership rights to tangibles. So opinions on this are divided.

What about other digital products. For the sale of digital products such as PDFs or MP3s there is no single international standard on what this kind of transaction is. Under some laws it is a licensing agreement, under others a property transfer. These technologies have been around for decades now.

The main argument in the book is that Bitcoin is something new, and we will need to develop new laws surrounding the transactions of property (especially with lightning). The problem is that regulators are not doing it because they are too busy trying to force BTC back into the old paradigm. So this will have to come from the industry.",1

BTC,2024-10-16,post,Bitcoin,Italy Raises Bitcoin Tax to 42% – Another Blow to Innovation and Financial Freedom,"The Italian government has just announced that the tax rate on capital gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will skyrocket from 26% to 42% starting next year. This outrageous increase is part of an attempt to “capture” more from the growing adoption of crypto. The Vice Minister of Economy even stated, “Since the phenomenon is spreading, we are taxing it more.” No clearer message could be sent: instead of encouraging innovation, Italy wants to punish it.

This new tax regime will stifle the budding crypto economy in Italy. Up until now, many Italians saw cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to diversify their investments and potentially counter inflation. But with this new punitive 42% rate, Italy sends a strong signal that any profits made in this space will be met with heavy taxation. This will likely push investors to either stop using crypto or move their assets and activities offshore, depriving the country of potential growth and jobs in blockchain and fintech.

The current 26% tax on crypto gains was already controversial, but this drastic jump makes Italy one of the most hostile jurisdictions for crypto traders and investors. It also raises questions of fairness. Why single out crypto assets with such a heavy tax burden compared to traditional investments? The government’s approach seems to ignore the fact that the crypto market is already highly volatile, making it much harder to guarantee profits compared to conventional financial assets.

What’s worse, these changes will hurt ordinary investors and small-time users more than they will hurt large institutions. Many retail investors, who got involved in crypto during the last bull market, will now face complex reporting obligations and heavy taxes if they decide to sell or trade their holdings. The only ones who might benefit are large players with access to expensive tax advisors who know how to navigate these rules.

This is yet another example of policymakers treating crypto users like cash cows. Instead of fostering innovation, Italy is alienating its crypto community at a time when other European nations, such as Switzerland and Portugal, are embracing blockchain technology and welcoming crypto businesses with favorable regulations.",1298

When Bitcoin went from $1 to $100, that's 100x.

105k x 1620 = 170m/coin and a market cap of  3300T or 100 times the size of gold. 


It's too big to grow hundreds or thousands of times at size, but in terms of increase in the dollar value, yes, this will be the biggest increase in dollar value, but not market size.

BTC,2024-11-22,post,Bitcoin,"In Light of the Current BTC Bull Market, Here’s How I Got Scammed in 2022 😔","Hey everyone,  

With Bitcoin soaring again in this bull market, I’ve been reflecting on my past experiences with crypto. Unfortunately, not all of them have been good, and I wanted to share my story from 2022 when I fell victim to a Bitcoin scam. I hope this serves as a warning for others as excitement around crypto grows.  

### **Here’s what happened:**  
Back in 2022, I saw a tweet from what appeared to be Elon Musk’s verified account (blue checkmark and all). The tweet claimed Tesla and Elon were celebrating innovation with a BTC giveaway. It included a link to a site where participants could “send 1 BTC and get 2 BTC back.”  

The website looked **incredibly legit**, featuring Tesla branding, a countdown timer, and what seemed like real-time transaction updates. I didn’t think twice, especially since it came from a verified account.  

I sent **1 BTC** to this address:  
**[1KT2tbj7t7g9Djdsb9yFLNKeWxTKXJuKEd]**  

Here’s the transaction link:  
https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/f881c2c319f7adf8f7f2c2f67fcdf1654f29b2350a999fece176fe184d00449d 

After sending the funds, the tweet disappeared, and the truth hit me like a ton of bricks – the account had been fake, and I’d just been scammed out of 1 BTC.

If it makes you feel any better...

In retrospect everything about it was sus... but I texted my brother in law the link and said ""jump on this ASAP!"" - he instantly recognized it was a scam, and I felt like crap... gald I or he didn't fall for it...

I say this just to show that anyone can fall for this... I have a masters degrees in cryptography, and an ungrad in engineering, with an IQ in the 140s... and I even fell for it. Fortunately I didn't have any BTC to send at the time...

All you have to do is DCA and hold. So painfully simple in a world of complicated financial landscapes designed to separate you from your money.

I’m sure I’m missing more bullish items. The only negative I can think of is the language of crypto and digital assets that gets used and not straight up Bitcoin.  

Is it cause no new money has hit yet?  Countries and states have bills but no inflow of money until they go through. Banks now have more favorable regulations around bitcoin but no big banks have started doing anything yet.

Saylor isn't buying as much as he was.

Price action follows a bell curve. 99% of the price action happens 1% of the time.

I believe it was Adam Beck once said 6 days a year where price action happens.

> -15+ states with SBR bills

Small amounts.

> -Czech Republic and other nation state interest

Not happened yet, small amounts. What was it 5% of 140bn Euros? So 7bn? Saylor was doing that over a couple of days not long ago.

> -Executive Orders from trump

A workgroup will report back, until then nothing. When report back it will likely be *""Don't sell coins we already hold""* rather than *""Buy coins""*

> -Lummis bill on the table

It's not on the table. Trump has taken the initiative with EO. It will be Trump's show, not Lummis's.

> -Relatively good comments from Jerome Powell on banks role with Bitcoin

Trump EO forced him to not be negative. His comments were an attempt to not engage but at the same time not violate the EO.

Bingo. Gotta actually buy Bitcoin for the price to go up.

BTC,2025-03-31,post,BitcoinMarkets,If US is entering a bear market how would you expect bitcoin to perform over the next 6 months?,"This post isn’t about if a US bear market is about to happen or not. It’s how you think bitcoin would perform IF indeed a US bear market did happen now.

Bitcoin has been pretty correlated with the US market over the past 5 months since its post election bump. Over the past 7 weeks since s and p high Feb 19 bitcoin has dropped 13% and been unable to rise back anywhere near its Feb 19 value same as the market struggling to regain its peak. As opposed to gold price which has continued rising.

Looking back at 2022 bear market I see that was a brutal year for bitcoin.

I’m a big bitcoin believer and have a good chuck of my brokerage in IBIT. I’ve been waiting for bitcoin to show it can diverge from the US market like gold but I haven’t seen any evidence of it. And now I have some concern how low it could go and how long it may stay depressed if we are entering a bear market.

I forget exact data but I think around 15-25% of bitcoin is held by US/canadian investors. So vast majority is global investors. That gives me some hope it can diverge. But the positive news of US institutional adoption may be mitigated by US economy crashing, and EU and other key countries haven’t seemed to show much adoption of it yet, right?

BTC,2024-11-28,post,BitcoinMarkets,Let’s talk about Bitcoin price retractions (why they happen and when the next one is coming),"The so called “crypto winter” of 2022 shocked many new investors of crypto, but the history of Bitcoin tells us these retractions are quite normal-healthy, even.  They seem to occur approximately a year after Bitcoin hits ATH for that 4 year cycle.  Here are some notable past retractions.

1. December 2013 : Bitcoin = $1000.
December 2014: Bitcoin = $375.(62% drop)

2.December 2017 : Bitcoin = $17,000.
December 2018 : Bitcoin = $3,200.(80% drop)

3.November 2021 : Bitcoin = $64,000.
November 2022: Bitcoin = $16,000.(75% drop)

So why does this happen?  And will it happen this current cycle?

The why:

For each price retraction, you can potentially argue for unique reasons why they occurred.  For example, in 2022 the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 7 times, from nearly 0 to 4.25-4.50%.

But in general, I believe the reliable timing of these price retractions (admittedly with only 3 data points) signal that they occur due to pure crowd psychology and the fact that demand side buying pressure is difficult to sustain over long periods of time.  Remember that demand typically increases approx. one year prior to halving and at this point in the cycle, increased demand needs to be sustained for nearly 3 continuous years to keep increasing price.

The factors at ATH are: 
1. Investors begin taking profits.
2. People who bought near the top due to FOMO (and have little regard for fundamentals) see this correction due to selling pressure and panic sell, fueling further losses.  
3.  The news cycle starts to report on the “bubble bursting,” often reporting headlines without proper context (“Bitcoin down 35%!” Without stating the time period it was down 35%)
4. Many investors of Bitcoin are aware of the 4 year cycle.  And while we collectively prepare for the post halving bull run, as price reaches a hypothetical ATH, it’s every man for himself in terms of exit strategy.  You take profits based on your own unique financial situation.  Demand side pressure slowly decreases, and the price trades sideways for months, followed by slow losses but constant losses each month.

Conclusion: So will we see another price retraction this cycle?

Answer:  Most likely, yes.  But it depends on why you believe they occur.  If you believe, as I do, that price retractions are fundamentally due to 2 things-The difficulty in sustaining increased demand side buy pressure over 3 continuous years and basic crowd psychology-

Then, yes, a huge price retraction is coming one year after BTC hits ATH.  If Bitcoin maxes out at 150k in December 2025, history tells us that December 2026 could reveal a Bitcoin price of $50,000 (65% drop.). 

If you believe that each price retraction was unique in nature, then no, there may not be one this cycle.  

Cheers!

BTC,2024-11-28,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Let’s talk about Bitcoin price retractions (why th...,"Generally agree. Would summarize as: 
halving is followed by bitcoin becoming overbought for a number of reasons. It then corrects by becoming oversold until it establishes its base and then the cycle repeats. 
If it becomes overbought again this time I’d expect to follow by being oversold, if it doesn’t become overbought it may avoid the big “crash” ",3
BTC,2024-11-28,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Let’s talk about Bitcoin price retractions (why th...,"I operate under the assumption that BTC is a heavily manipulated asset. 

Smart money are creating these pumps and dumps in order to:

- first of all: take money from weak hands (usually poor people), and then take their BTC later as well

- second of all: they are trying to distribute BTC in a way to make people believe it has certain value, and they do it by selling it to as many people as possible at these certain price points (for example: 50 to 70k in the recent months), and later for like 120k, etc

So basically it’s a vessel for separating people from their hard earned money, and transferring it to the smart money players. 

Some lucky individuals will manage to remain with their BTC, but they won’t have too much of it, or they would have bought it at very bad prices (like 2021 ATH). And then there’s very few of those who actually got in early and made big bank. 

But it does make you think: amidst all these BTC maxis shitting on fiat and usd etc: why do these smart money want their fiat so bad? To the point they’re manipulating the BTC market to such an extent?

And finally: later these pumps or dumps get blamed on some random news, like FTX fraud, or whatnot. Just so these newbies can feel like they understand what’s happening, and not wonder who has their money now.

Because the next time will be different: the next time the news will be good or normal, and BTC can pump indefinitely. 

Nope.

As a Post Script:

I do feel like this time might be different, with growing adoption, and more serious players joining, it can already be seen as if BTC is stabilizing compared to previous years. But I also might just be walking right into that good old BTC moon boy trap.",15

BTC,2025-03-15,post,BitcoinMarkets,⚡ Quick Bitcoin Order Book & Market Analysis with Your Morning Coffee ☕ 15 March 2025,"Bitcoin is currently moving between two liquidity zones. Yesterday, we cleared the strong seller wall at $84,500, meaning this resistance no longer exists.

Now, we can see that institutional buyers have set up strong buy walls over the weekend, indicating a potential accumulation phase before the next move.

⸻

📉 Order Book & Key Liquidity Zones

🔹 Support Zones (Buy Orders):

✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC in buy orders

✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC in buy orders

✅ $81,500 – $81,800 → ~1,500 BTC in buy orders (largest buy wall)

💡 These are likely set by institutional players, not retail traders’ limit orders.

🔹 Resistance Zones (Sell Orders):

🚩 $87,500 → Massive sell wall with ~1,500 BTC

🚩 $88,000 → More than 1,000 BTC in short stop-loss orders

📌 Potential scenario:

If Bitcoin bounces from strong support zones, it will likely squeeze liquidity from short sellers at $87,000+ and possibly spike through $88,000 to clear stop losses.

⸻

📊 Trading Plan for Today

🎯 Strategy:

	•	Entering a short-term long from $83,500 – $82,500
	•	Targeting $87,000 – $88,000
	•	Exiting with a limit order, since a wick and sharp retracement are likely in that range

💡 Be cautious: Institutional players have set a “trap” around Bitcoin, holding it in their controlled liquidity zones. Weekends are highly manipulative—either range-bound or suddenly spiking up/down to liquidate both sides.

⸻

📢 Final Thoughts

In my opinion, Bitcoin remains bullish for now. However, expect potential market manipulation over the weekend.

Wishing everyone a great day, solid profits, and a strong cup of coffee! ☕🚀
And remember—never stop believing in Bitcoin and financial independence! 💪🔥

Bitcoin cycles follow historical patterns, but market participants - retail, whales, institutions - all of us - are increasingly self-aware and we are adjusting our behavior. This feedback loop is altering cycle dynamics, making timing strategies less predictable.

Current herd knowledge has lead to a front run of the cycle peak, and has also muted the acceleration typically seen in past cycles. We’re stuck in the range. 

We’re all sitting around with our positions comfortably in profit, waiting for “retail” to trigger the cycle top. 

Not going to happen. When everyone is timing the cycle, the cycle is modified. Cycle dynamics will become more stable. We’re seeing it now. Mid cycle downside risk of 25%? It doesn’t feel so bad. Lots of money on the sideline timing the pullback. It means that upside potential will be muted as well, as we all front run each other’s profit taking.

BTC,2024-12-09,comment,BitcoinMarkets,"Comment on: ₿itcoin priced at $100,000 is a better buy than ₿i...","A few critiques here:

1) In investments, risk is correlated directly to potential reward. Things with more risk have more potential of reward. So saying it's less risky is also saying there's less upward potential. You don't get to have less risk and more (or even equal) potential.

2) I would try to avoid statements that you could make at any price point. You could make the same argument at $101,000. Or $125,000. Or $1,000,000. If it's an argument that literally always applies, then it's probably not all that insightful.

3) Your other comments mention it being ""multiple millions per coin"" - you're trying to have it both ways. Saying it doesn't carry risk and it also has potential to ~50x or more seems dubious.

4) If bitcoin is ultimately something to be used and held by individual people - then that's only around $40 trillion (priced in USD) or so depending on which estimate you would look at? If bitcoin replaced literally all money, it wouldn't even make it to two million per coin.

It's a fine sentiment, but it really seems like you're backing into reasoning that you already agree with, rather than looking as an objective observer.

You could apply this logic to literally any company stock or asset by just substituting a few words. It doesn't really contain anything about bitcoin.",6

With a current market cap of a little under 2T it's nearly impossible that it will 10x again in another 4 years. That would mean over taking the market capitalization of Gold and that would require a massive inflow of capital that I just dont think is there. 



On the flip meanwhile Bitcoin continues to be risky, less risky than 4 years ago sure but the massive upside is gone also.

On the daily, the RSI is currently 45.4 (44.6 average). Some near supports are 95, 93.5, 92 and 87.3. Current resistances are 97.4, 100, 104, 106.1, 108-109 area and price discovery higher.

The weekly RSI is currently 61.6 (69.0 average). With the weekly close around 96.5, the upward channel is still intact. Hopefully BTC will rise to 98.0-98.5 to close inside the channel. The C&H, which has been confirmed (which happened on Nov.4), has a price target of 122.5k and has a 95% success rate. Additionally, the C&H also had an IH&S within it with a price target of 133k. When BTC breaks out of the current crab, bull flag target is 141k.

Bitcoin closed January in the red with it’s monthly RSI at 75.7 Current RSI is 71.3 The RSI average is 68.9 and still not considered overbought. It is looking more and more like the 2016 halving rather than the 2020 one. I overlayed 2020 Sept-March pattern and the Sept 2016-Dec 2017 also. BTC is in it’s 10^(th) month after halving. The 2016-17 was 17 months from halving to peak, the 2020-21 was 18 months from halving to peak. Lots of time left or run.

Good luck to all traders and DCAers.

BTC,2024-12-16,post,BitcoinMarkets,"How sure are we that there will be another bear market as pronounced as those seen in 2018, 2022 etc? With ETFs could this change the pattern?","Now that crypto has institutional investment and ETFs, I think it is likely that bear markets and bull runs are going to be less pronounced than they were in the past. Perhaps even the four year cycle that we've come to expect will fall apart soon.

The thing is all of us are waiting for 2026 or so for the next bear market, and we all are going to buy in then. However, how disappointed would we be if (lets assume this round BTC peaks at 140K) BTC actually bottomed out at 90K or something, and then in the next run it just made it to 180K in 2028. This scenarios would likely be disappointing to many on here, but I see this type of thing is pretty realistic.

At a certain point, is it not true that this whole thing will not be happening? After all, if cryptocurrency indeed does become a major currency, its value will be pretty stable. None of this stuff will matter anymore. How far is that though?

How powerful is the halving in reality?

BTC,2024-12-17,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: How sure are we that there will be another bear ma...,"Perhaps I've drank too much of the Saylor koolaid, but I think aggregate demand is going to far outstrip newly minted coins from now on. Ergo 80% drawdowns are of a thing of the past. I could see 50-60% maybe if we hit FOMO that's prodominately retail driven as we have in past cycles, but I think retail interest in BTC has largely subsided. Either due to a preference for alts (driven by greed/unit bias) or from being burnt last cycle.

The two variables I'm looking at to determine whether 4 year cycle theory is ending are:

1. Widespread adoption by governments

2. Widespread adoption by big name companies

At that point it's just game theory and network effect playing out with predictable consequences. Retail sentiment will no longer matter as the vast majority of buying will be institutional. Digital gold and inflation hedge becoming the dominant narrative. We're not quite there yet, but I believe the stage is set for it this cycle with the FASB rule changes, ETFs, and strategic reserve talks.

Just one guy's perspective.",5

BTC,2024-12-17,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: How sure are we that there will be another bear ma...,"My opinion.  Yes, we're going to see a bear market again at the end of 2026, probably to around 75k.  Certainly Under 100k.  

I've come to believe there are many things INHERENT IN THE NETWORK that are causing all of this.  The price swings, the bubbles, the bottoms, etc.  All of that, combined with human nature,  mining, hash-rate, network effects, etc - are causing all of this.  

No ETF, no FTX, no government reserve. . . . will change the fundamentals of the network.  Now, macro events DO cause fluctuations, and big ones.  But, without sounding philosophical, bitcoin practically ""has a mind of its own"".  It will do what bitcoin does.  ""tick tock , next block"".  

And I'll give one example I feel very strongly about.  Lets start with the ""1M in 2025"" crowd.  I've never seen so many smart people act so stupid.  It's as if these people totally forgot that as price goes up, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE WILLING TO SELL.  Let me repeat that, as price goes up, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE WILLING TO SELL.  They act like demand will be some constant linear ""up-forever"" line.  Markets do not work like that, and its been proven 3x or more that the bitcoin market does not work like that.  

Let me tell you specifically why bitcoin will not hit 1m this cycle, even if 4 big countries start accumulating a bitcoin reserve.  In one sentence:  ""The cost to mine 1 bitcoin is not high enough yet, combined with the fact that many people will sell their bitcoin go for a higher price.""",6

This is version 1.0, so feel free to roast me with constructive criticism—anything to make this spreadsheet more *signal* than *noise*. Formatting tweaks, broken links, useless indicators to axe, new ones to add—hit me with it all.

The plan is to update this bad boy once or twice a month, but if the market starts getting *spicy*, you bet your ass I’ll be posting it daily. Honestly, I’m looking forward to those chaotic times. Anyway, here it is—go easy on me (or don’t).

|Indicator Description|Indicator & Link|December 29 Value|Flashing?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart for Bitcoin is king. Comparing the RSI to where previous tops have petered out can show when Bitcoin is overheated. Each cycle is likely to show a smaller RSI peak, so a decline in max RSI over time is expected.|[Monthly RSI >80](https://charts.bitbo.io/monthly-rsi/)|75.5|No|
|The monthly Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence (LMACD) has been on a macro downtrend. Each cycle top has gotten very close to this down slope. In April 2021, LMACD hit 0.41, and the trendline was at 0.44 (93% of the way to hitting it).|[LMACD within 10% of the down trend line](https://postimg.cc/ZvFtXTbZ)|0.05|No|
|The Pi Cycle Top Indicator has been an easy way to determine if things are overheated.|[Pi Cycle Top Crosses](https://charts.bitbo.io/pi-cycle-top/)|Top is 133k|No|
|The MVRV Z-Score measures how far Bitcoin’s market value is from its realized value in standard deviations, highlighting periods of extreme overvaluation or undervaluation. It improves on the MVRV ratio by standardizing data for better comparisons across market cycles.|[MVRV Z-Score >6](https://charts.bitbo.io/mvrv-z-score/)|2.59|No|
|The Power Law Chart is a linear regression channel based on historical Bitcoin price. It represents the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and time and has been remarkably accurate.|[Halfway up the 'top channel'](https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/)|Currently bottom of 'top channel'|No|
|Transaction volume measures the economic throughput of BTC on the blockchain. Onchain Volume reflects the total cryptocurrency moving between wallets on a blockchain, giving insight into network health. Monthly volume exceeding $5 trillion—and reaching an all-time high of $8 trillion—signals significant activity.|[Monthly Volume >$5T, then >$8T](https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoins-adjusted-on-chain-volume-daily)|2.0T|No|
|The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a Halving Price Regression (HPR) is a non-linear logarithmic trend line based solely on Bitcoin prices at the three halving dates, excluding hype cycles to provide a conservative price forecast, with colored bands indicating years ahead of the trend.|[Price moves into Orange Band](https://charts.bitbo.io/rainbow/)|Green Band|No|
|Altcoin Season Index refers to a market phase where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin in terms of price growth. The Altcoin Season Index measures this by analyzing the performance of the top 50 altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a given period. A high index score suggests a strong altcoin season, while a low score indicates Bitcoin dominance|[AltSeason Index score >90](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/)|49|No|
|Historically, Bitcoin Transaction Fees Spike during bull market peaks. If daily transaction fees exceed $40, it usually signals overheating.|[Bitcoin average daily transaction fee >$40](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#alltime)|$1.75|No|
|The Volatility-Adjusted Power Law Index (VPLI) adjusts for volatility to provide clearer value regions across Bitcoin’s lifecycle. When red values appear and begin to decline, it aligns with market cycle tops.|[VPLI Red Zone Indicates Cycle Tops (>85)](https://www.bitcoingoodfiatbad.com/charts/power-law-volatility-adjusted-index)|Green, 60|No|
|When Bitcoin Dominance sharply drops (15-20% over 4 weeks), it signals lost momentum, with capital flowing into altcoins or stablecoins. Historically, a dominance level under 47% aligns with market pullbacks.|[15% Pullback within a month or BTC dominance <47%](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/)|4% pullback, dominance 58%|No|
|When the Number of cryptos with a market cap >$1 billion exceeds 200, it often signals overheating. A sustained decline below the 7-week moving average of these coins indicates a market top.|[\>200 coins >$1B cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/?page=2)|99 coins above 1B|No|
|Rising Stablecoin Market Cap (e.g., Tether) can reflect higher purchasing power or profit-taking. If the cap increases significantly over 4 months (e.g., >2.5x), it often indicates higher risk.|[USDT cap >2.5x in 4 months](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BvgWh9QV/)|Up about 15%|No|
|The 200 Week Moving Average Heatmap has historically been a reliable indicator. Orange or red dots on the chart signal market overheating and a good time to sell.|[Orange and Red Dots Appear](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/200-week-moving-average-heatmap/)|Deep Blue|No|
|The CBBI Indicator combines 9 metrics to estimate Bitcoin market cycles, helping identify price tops or bottoms.|[Confidence >75/100 = Market Peak](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)|79|Yes|
|The Mayer Multiple, the current Bitcoin price divided by its 200-day moving average, highlights historically significant price ranges. Values above 2.4 suggest market euphoria.|[Over 2.4](https://charts.bitbo.io/mayermultiple/)|1.33|No|
|The NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) metric shows market-wide profit or loss. Values above 0.75 indicate market euphoria and potential tops.|[Over 75%](https://charts.bitbo.io/net-unrealized-profit-loss/)|57%|No|
|The Terminal Price normalizes historical Bitcoin behavior to current conditions by multiplying Transferred Price by 21 (max supply in millions). This has effectively forecasted cycle peaks.|[Price Rises Above Terminal Price](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/terminal-price/)|Terminal Price 188k|No|
|The 4-Year MA Multiple compares the Bitcoin price to its 4-year moving average. Historically, peaks above 4.5x have aligned with market tops.|[Value ≥ 4](https://charts.bitbo.io/sma1458/)|\~2|No|
|The Coinbase App Rank hitting the top 10 in mobile store rankings, usually 4 weeks or less before market tops, has historically signaled euphoria.|[Top 10 in App Rankings](https://x.com/COINAppRankBot)|Rank 190|No|
|Google searches for 'Cheapest Crypto' spiking above 75 (trend score) have historically aligned with market euphoria.|[Trend Score >75](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=cheapest%20crypto&hl=en)|44|No|
|The Puell Multiple is a metric that evaluates the selling pressure from Bitcoin miners by comparing the daily mining revenue (in USD) to its 365-day simple moving average. It helps traders assess how miners' revenue impacts market dynamics, particularly during periods of forced selling.|[Pay attention above 2.5](https://charts.bitbo.io/puell-multiple/%20)|1.07|No|

BTC,2025-06-15,comment,BitcoinMarkets,"Comment on: [Daily Discussion] - Sunday, June 15, 2025...","Good day to you all.

The possibility that BTC has a good chance of closing green with everything happening between Isreal and Iran is extremely bullish to me. A close at 105785 will make it a green week.

On the daily, the RSI is at 50.1 (53.5 average). BTC had been in a downward sloping channel, retraced to just past the .382 FIB and broke out if the channel/the handle of the daily C&H.  BTC has now retraced to just above the .786 FIB on the most recent bounce from the retrace, which was a test of the handle from the breakout & 50dSMA. Price target for the C&H is about 140.0. Some longer-term supports are 104.0, 101.5, 100.0, 97.4, 95.0, 93.5, and 91.5 .  Current resistance is 106.1, 108.4, 112.0 and then on to price discovery and new ATHs.

The weekly RSI is currently 63.2 (56.3 average). The weekly C&H, had been confirmed on Nov.4 2024, has a price target of 122.5k and has a 95% success rate. Additionally, the weekly C&H also had an IH&S within it with a price target of 133k. When BTC breaks out of this crab/bull flag, the target is now 150.5k. BTC just had the retest of the neckline after the breakout from the neckline of the IH&S that spans the weekly and monthly charts.

Bitcoin closed May in the green (+11.1%) with it’s monthly RSI at 69.3. This was following Aprils gains of 14.1%. Current RSI is 69.5. The RSI average is 67.4. I overlayed 2020 Sept-March pattern and the Sept 2016-Dec 2017 also. BTC is in it’s 14^(th) month after halving. The 2016-17 was 17 months from halving to peak, the 2020-21 was 18 months from halving to peak. Lots of time left or run. BTC has diverged significantly from previous cycles. My thoughts to a possibility of how price will play out, if it acts like gold did after it’s ETFs. That would be just a repeated up and crab/retrace, like BTC just went through recently. There would be no winter. Just repeated 50%+/- jumps in price with 30%+/- pullbacks. If a new pattern is emerging, I would expect the next mini-peak/start of the mini-pullback to happen in July.

Good luck to all traders and DCAers.

Since then they have raised and deployed $27.3 billion over the course of 6 months, moving way quicker than planned. MSTR has been averaging $1.05 billion in BTC buys per week since then.

MSTR’s newly announced 42/42 plan means they still have $56.7 billion left to raise and deploy out of an $84 billion goal. The timeline they outlined for this plan was 2 years. But it’s extremely likely they will execute on this much quicker than planned yet again. Expect MSTR to deploy closer to $2 billion into BTC on average every single week for the next several months.

Since MSTR originally announced their 21/21 plan BTC has traded from as low as $66.8k on November 4, 2024 to as high as $109.1k on January 20, 2025. If MSTR does in fact end up averaging closer to $2 billion in buys per week going forward, it’s extremely likely BTC is headed to new highs very soon, within days/weeks. Be prepared.",32

BTC,2025-01-25,comment,BitcoinMarkets,"Comment on: [Daily Discussion] - Saturday, January 25, 2025...","The spring is coiling up tightly imo.

On the daily, the RSI is currently 60.8 (57.7 average). Some near supports are 104, 102.7, 100, 97.4, 95, 93.5, 92 and 87.3. Current resistance are 106.1, 108.4 and price discovery higher. A nice pennant has formed.

The weekly RSI is currently 69.5 (69.0 average). BTC broke out of the bull flag on the weekly. The retest of previous the resistance of 100k is typical. The breakout of this new bull flag has a price target of 141k. The upward channel is still intact and BTC could go as high as 120k next week without breaking out of it. The C&H, which has been confirmed (which happened on Nov.4), has a price target of 122.5k and has a 95% success rate. Additionally, the C&H also had an IH&S within it with a price target of 133k.

Bitcoin closed December in the red with it’s monthly RSI at 73.1. Current RSI is 76.3 The RSI average is 68.3 and still not considered overbought. It is looking more and more like the 2016 halving rather than the 2020 one. I overlayed 2020 Sept-March pattern and the Sept 2016-Dec 2017 also. BTC is in it’s 9^(th) month after halving. The 2016-17 was 17 months from halving to peak, the 2020-21 was 18 months from halving to peak. Lots of time left or run.

Good luck to all traders and DCAers.

BTC,2025-06-02,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: [Altcoin Discussion] - June 2025...,"Happy June, you crazy degens. Some updates:

* Last month, I posted about Bigcoin ($BIG) as the first and only onchain mining system. That still remains true. There have been other derivatives that have come out, trying to copy what Bigtoshi built, but none have succeeded. $BIG was in the $1-2 range. Things seemed to be consolidating, Bigtoshi was working on ""merge mining"" (essentially lets you direct your Bigcoin miners to other coin launching, effectively solving the sniping/fair launch problem in crypto). It was supposed to launch within 48 hours after Bigtoshi tweeted...except it never did. Bigtoshi went *silent* for two weeks. No updates, nothing. Price started bleeding out to $0.60 range...until today. You can check Bigtoshi's twitter, but apparently there was an issue with the contract migration. As a result, it was all hands on deck for Bigtoshi. All is well now, though. Price has recovered a bit to over $0.80. Update [here](https://x.com/satoshibigmoto/status/1929500258343797022). Enough about Bigcoin though. This was always going to be an extremely high risk project. There is something far, far more interesting imo going on right now. See next bullet point.
* As I have said countless times before, when it comes to altcoins, I care about one thing and one thing only: **can the alt outperform Bitcoin?** The answer, for 99% of altcoins is a big NO. It is extremely rare to find something that actually has a sustainable value accrual mechanism that pushes the price of the coin to outperform BTC. In fact, I'd argue we actually have not seen that coin emerge yet....until, *I think,* now. See my next bullet point. 
* For anyone keeping track of news in crypto lately, you probably have heard of James Wynn. He's the trader who was essentially longing and shorting BTC at different times on *40x leverage* using *hundreds of millions* of dollars. His largest trade at one point was a 40x long on BTC worth a notional value of 1.1 billion dollars. Yes, BILLION. How is this possible? How are we able to *see* this guy's massive trade in real time? The answer is Hyperliquid ($HYPE)**.** See next bullet point. 
* Essentially, Hyperliquid is the first and only on-chain, decentralized, transparent Central Limit Order Book (CLOB). It's essentially a Binance or Coinbase, but fully on chain. This has *never happened before*, and for anyone who understands trading infrastructure, no one has been able to build this or even thought about building this. Imo, Hyperliquid is the ""0 to 1"" for trading infrastructure. BTC was 0 to 1 for money. ETH was 0 to 1 for smart contracts (side note: bless ETH's heart, it has horrible value accrual, as evidenced by the long term ETH/BTC downtrend). Anyways, most dexes today are just AMMs, which although are innovative in their own right, have many downsides when compared to a CLOB. I won't go into the details too much, but the CLOB model is essentially far more efficient and faster than the AMM model. This is why James Wynn trades on Hyperliquid, and it is why Hyperliquid is even able to handle trades of his size. It's why high frequency trading happens on Hyperliquid. None of this would be possible (in an efficient way) on an AMM.
* Okay. Now we have established, again, in my opinion, that Hyperliquid is something special. Woopdy doo. All coins claim to be ""special"". What I care about most, again, is **can the coin outperform Bitcoin**? To do that, a coin needs a **very, very, very strong** **value accrual mechanism** that drives the price of the coin up, forever, at a faster rate than Bitcoin. Because let's be honest it is extremely difficult to outperform the hardest asset in human history. Hyperliquid has that mechanism coded into the protocol. See next point.
* \~54% of the protocol’s fee revenue is used to buy $HYPE off the market. There are other smaller token sinks as well, but Hyperliquid as a protocol essentially has a hyper-aggressive (pun intended) stock buyback built into it. It creates direct value accrual and continuous deflation for holders. 5% of the token supply has already been bought back and burned since early 2025. **5% since early 2025!!!!** This is fucking insane imo. At current burn rates, **14–18% of supply could be removed yearly**. Even modest growth from here could drive a 2–5x in value just from fundamentals, easily. Further, since launching less than 2 years ago, Hyperliquid has hit $6B–$10B daily trading volume (about 10% of Binance’s, and grown its user base by approx 800%. This is insane growth for a coin that was totally organic. No VCs, no presale, no insider dumping, none of that. This thing is growing like crazy *because* of prior bullet point above. Insane growth=more buybacks=token go up forever. Hyperliquid is a black hole that is eating all volume and liquidity from CEXes...in the same way that Bitcoin is a black hole for SoV/money.
* Valuation-wise, $HYPE currently trades at around **10x P/E**, compared to \~50x for Coinbase, \~40x for Solana, and 150x+ for Ethereum...despite stronger user growth, real cashflow, and direct buyback mechanics. Imo even at \~$30 it's still stupidly undervalued for a coin that could actually be ""The House of All Finance"". Remember Greshamn's law? ""**Bad money drives out good"".** That means people spend their ""bad"" money (fiat) and hoard ""good"" money (BTC). THE SAME LAW APPLIES  TO TRADING/LIQUIDITY! You heard it here first. Hyperliquid.

Now, I am always open to discussion and criticism. Let's hear it!",2

Yea sure there's still some random pumps here and there, but this cycle is **completely** different from prior cycles. In prior cycles you could buy literally anything, no matter how scammy or shitty, and likely do very well as long as BTC was in a bull market. Those days of ""free money"" are long, long gone. 

BTC has found clear product-market fit. 99% of all other altcoins have no PMF, at all, have no value accrual, and are just going to slowly bleed out to near zero (of course they will never actually reach literal 0) Might take a few years. Might take decades. But it will happen.",4

BTC,2024-09-28,comment,BitcoinMarkets,"Comment on: [Daily Discussion] - Saturday, September 28, 2024...","On the daily, BTC’s RSI is currently 65.1 (60.4 average). Major resistances are 69 and ATH, with a lot of minor ones in between. The nearest major supports are 63 and 57.5 with multiple minor support levels along the way. The 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA are 60110/61055/63794 and have acted as resistance/support as BTC moves up. BTC is still in the rising channel and the top of the channel for today (around 68.5) is also around the resistance line of the bull flag it has been in since March.

The RSI on the weekly is currently 56.0 (51.9 average). It has been in a widening wedge/flag formation since March with multiple touches on the top and bottom. It is currently getting near the middle of the flag. Looking for a strong close above the flag on the weekly for confirmation of a breakout. If this is a confirmed continuation pattern, the target would be above 100k. An IH&S has formed with the current move back up. BTC confirmed the pattern with the close of the week strongly above the neckline. The price target for the IH&S is 80k. Main resistances were noted above.

Bitcoin closed August out in the red with it’s monthly RSI at 60.8. Current RSI 64.2. September is looking to end in the green. Still a little over a week left though. The 5^(th) month after halving is usually green. Take it with a grain of salt, it could be a coincidence, but with the FED now easing, the money printers are being turned up higher.

Good luck to all traders and DCAers.

BTC,2025-02-22,post,BitcoinMarkets,How Much Political Opinions & Political Discussion Should Be Allowed in The Daily Threads?,"Until recently, this subreddit was mostly politics-free.

But, as Governments and Politicians around the world begin to pay more attention to Bitcoin, political discussion in our Daily Threads has become more and more common and is occasionally getting out of hand and generating a lot of reports to the moderators.

[Example of a comment thread that inspired me to create this poll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ivb2ts/comment/me4t91z/)

Sometimes this discussion is related to Bitcoin public policy (proposed or passed laws, bitcoin-related government policies, etc), sometimes it is 1% about Bitcoin and 99% the poster's unrelated political opinions, often it is completely unrelated to Bitcoin and devolves into bickering and name calling that generates a lot of reports and work for the mod team.

I'm curious what YOU want to see.

Options:

1. **Bitcoin-related public policy, NOT politics:** You want to see news, discussion, and debate around how Bitcoin-related public policy and laws may impact the Bitcoin price (ex: Strategic Bitcoin Reserves, SAB121, court cases, any policies or laws that may affect Bitcoin) but you **DO NOT** want to see users injecting their opinions on politics or specific politicians into the discussion because it often derails the conversation.
2. **Political Discussion is fine, even if barely related to Bitcoin, as long as it doesn't violate Rule #1:** You don't mind if people are discussing or debating politics in the Daily Threads, as long as it starts off related to Bitcoin, even if it devolves into non-Bitcoin related discussion, and everyone is being respectful to their fellow traders.
3. **I'm here for TA and charts only! I don't care about Governments' Bitcoin policies nor politics:** You're a TA-only type of trader that believes news and what governments do doesn't move markets. You don't want to see any discussion about government policies, laws, politicians, or politics in the Daily Threads. Charts, lines, and astrology for men ONLY!
4. **I love politics and debating about it with anyone and everyone!** You are obsessed with politics. You spend your days on r/politics and wish every subreddit was a place where you could debate politics and argue about politicians all day long.
5. **Something Else (that I posted below):** You have a different idea of how the mods should approach political discussion that you have posted below as a reply.

This poll will close in 7 days.

Disclaimer: There is absolutely zero guarantee the results of this poll will influence any moderator decisions, I'm mainly curious what YOU want to see in the Daily Threads. **As always, all subreddit rules apply, especially rules #1 and #2.** Keep hitting the report button for any content that violates any rules in the sidebar.

BTC,2025-02-22,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: How Much Political Opinions & Political Discussion...,"Theoretically, any politics related to BTC or even broader markets should be fine. Very simple.

But as seen today, [top-level reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ivb2ts/daily_discussion_saturday_february_22_2025/me4t91z/) mentions ""markets will go down because of Trump"" = fine, but also calls him a Russian asset. Personally, I only [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ivb2ts/daily_discussion_saturday_february_22_2025/me4xfsw/) to the market aspect as that seems relevant for this sub.

In this regard, I would say top comment strict (must relate to markets) makes sense, but replies can be less strict assuming they are replying to OP.

BTC,2025-02-22,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: How Much Political Opinions & Political Discussion...,"I’ve mentioned this perspective in the past. Bitcoin is inherently radical and disruptive. From inception to execution it is inherently a political project. Discussing bitcoin from any level beyond charts is going to be political and one of the good things about BTC and its creators is an embrace of that understanding.

I can understand keeping rails on conversations and I can understand and appreciate rule #1. But trying to gatekeep politics out of a space discussing how to diffuse centralized power in banking, intersecting with the energy economy, an acknowledgement that fiat is backed by violence, that’s all political. And honestly, embracing number go up and losing yourself to tribalism is also a political stance. 

Temper how abstract my sentiment is if you would like but if we enforce non political rules it will inevitably become subjective and prone to individual mods attitudes (also political). The bittybot suggestion is also strong since that at least diffuses the power to censor to the whole community (which skews libertarian lol).",3

BTC,2025-02-22,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: How Much Political Opinions & Political Discussion...,"All politicians are parasites.

All centralised power is slavery.

I see politics as something fairly neutral which calls can be made on in an (almost) binary way.

Like predicting that US will stay out of Ukraine and only use it as a profit source. Predicting that Russia will be allowed to take some ground without broader conflict. Predicting that Trump will take initiative from Lummis and make a ""SBR"" via EO.

These prediction type approaches to geo-politics or domestic politics and their impacts on markets are non-partisan in nature.

I understand too many people passionately tie their entire personality to one ruler or another and feel emotional distress whenever anything upsets their cognitive dissonance.

Though I don't see a problem with exercising the same kind of logic we exercise around market movements to geo-political machinations or domestic races between various scumbags.

If it's Trump vs Lummis or Putin vs Zelensky, when things happen outside of the defined acceptable limits these can quickly impact price. If someone sees those defined limits differently or has different perspective on what would be allowed or acceptable to the power balance... It seems relevant.",4

BTC,2025-07-13,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Week 28 - Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Updates...,"Thank you for you continuing diligence.

I'd love to know how much leverage is involved in these treasuries. And how many if these companies are profitable ex-bitcoin. That will give us important information for any downwave in the future.

In such a situation I expect the weaker ones may be acquired rather than selling their treasuries.",3

BTC,2025-07-12,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Week 28 - Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Updates...,"That is interesting and I appreciate your comment. But I personally don't think it's a trend because it's dependent on a few big buys (and imo next week will be much higher than 5k.) 

Previous 3 weeks we saw **1 entity** buy 4.9k BTC or more, so that changes it a lot:

Week | Total | # Companies acquiring | Strategy | Metaplanet | Other big (750+) | Others
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Week 23 | **4.6k** | 21 | 705 | 1.1k | Mara 942 | 1.8k
Week 24 | **2.6k** | 29 | 1k | 0 | - | 1.5k
Week 25 | **12.2k** | 20 | **10.1k** | 1.1k | - | 985
Week 26 | **10k** | 26 | 245 | 2.3k | ProCap BTC **4.9k**, BTCT.V 771 | 1.9k
Week 27 | **8.4k** | 22 | **5k** | 1k | Figma 843, Mara 761 | 854
Week 28 | **4.7k**| 35 | 0 | 2.2k | - | 2.5k


Some random notes: 

- IMO the number of companies buying BTC weekly is increasing, that would be the best trend imo.
- Strategy only paused because they don't like to buy at quarter-end. I am expecting a huge buy announcement from them next week (which was done this week of course, to be clear.)
- Metaplanet seems pretty consistent buying 1-2k
- Occasionally another company launches their treasury and shows a big buy: ProCap BTC is unique from all the ""merger types"" because they were able to use the USD to buy BTC before the merger. Nakamoto is an example that has a lot of cash now ($750+ million) but have to wait till merger to buy BTC lol.
- First 1-2 weeks of each month, you have miners announce how much BTC they net added previous month (= hodl, not sell) eg Mara's 761 in June announced last week.",6
BTC,2025-07-12,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Week 28 - Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Updates...,What are your favorite buys? What do you think happens if all these companies have a high mNAV and BTC keeps going up fast compressing the mNAV?,3
BTC,2025-07-12,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Week 28 - Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Updates...,Thanks. I only scrolled back enough for four weeks. Interesting to see six weeks worth.,3
BTC,2025-07-12,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Week 28 - Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Updates...,"My favorite buy remains to be **bitcoin** ;)

I have a few small bets here and there as I could be early. But honestly, I haven't done much mNAV etc analysis compared to other people.

I just like following how many BTC they are buying and how many new companies are added to the list each week :)",3

BTC,2025-01-13,post,BitcoinMarkets,Big Round Numbers Theory,"I have a theory, that each cycle has a big round target (x) that is 10 times higher than previous cycle target (y), because people like big round numbers:
    

    Cycle 1: x=100, y=N/A
    Cycle 2: x=1K, y=100
    Cycle 3: x=10K, y=1K
    Cycle 4: x=100K, y=10K
    Cycle 5: x=1M, y=100K

> Fun fact: Cycle 1 reached only 0.3x and never hit the target of x=100. This was because the first exchange and trading appeared only when the cycle was already two years old. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin was incorrectly set to $0.06 at the start of trading, so the price had to increase by more than three orders of magnitude in just two years — a tall order even for Bitcoin. Two years into mining, the fair price of Bitcoin should have been $6 at the start of trading, given the value it was already providing. Cycle 1 is usually excluded from the comparison charts due to its short time span and extreme volatility.

Now, let’s compare cycles 2-5 visually using targets x and y defined above.

My favorite cycle comparison chart is [Bitcoin Price After Halvings](https://x.com/HalvingTracker), however it suffers from two problems:

* **Problem 1**: it creates the false impression of diminishing returns due to unfortunate choice of vertical scaling, horizontal alignment and cycle definition.
* **Problem 2**: it doesn't show very well where we are in the current cycle in respect to common cycle stages for the same reasons.

Now, let’s improve each of these aspects.

# Better Vertical Scaling

Let’s scale this chart to cycle targets x and y defined above: https://imgur.com/a/mkdykNs

# Better Horizontal Alignment

While cycles vary in how quick the bull run starts (e.g., 2020 bull run was notoriously early to start), once the price moves past 1.4y, all cycles behave pretty much the same by shooting almost straight up, so let’s align cycles horizontally to this point in each cycle: https://imgur.com/a/5a58yUu

# Better Cycle Definition

Halvings don’t impact the price immediately and the price just fluctuates after halving boringly for variable number of months in each cycle, so let’s set cycle start to a time when the price moves past approximately 0.6y for the last time, because this is where the real action begins, and cycles start to move in sync: https://imgur.com/a/olJnSyZ

Compared to cycles defined by halving dates, dates of my cycles are offset by 1 to 8 months.

In this chart we finally begin to clearly see common cycle stages:

1. **Fight With Previous Target** – in the first stage all cycles start to immediately tackle the first mini-boss – previous cycle target y. A lot of people want to cash out during this stage, so it takes a lot of time – about 210 days, during which we range between 0.7y and 1.3y. Zoom to stage 1: https://imgur.com/a/GEMshA9

2. **Bull Run** – after slaying the first mini-boss, price shoots almost vertically up towards cycle target x. In this short second stage, we do or do not reach cycle target x, depending largely on the timing of the next China ban. 

3. **Bear Market** – in this stage we never fall below 1.5y (cycle 2 – $152, cycle 4 – $15,479).

4. **Recovery** – the last stage, when price recovers to a level that is higher by a factor of 10 (f10) compared to cycle start. We stay at approximately f10 price level for varying months until this cycle ends and new cycle begins.

Here are all the cycles with start and end dates, start and end price, ratio between end/start price and cycle lengths:



    Cycle 1: 2010-10-07 ($0.06) – 2013-03-20 ($61.7) – 965.32 – 895 days
    Cycle 2: 2013-03-20 ($61.7) – 2016-10-05 ($611) – 9.90 – 1295 days
    Cycle 3: 2016-10-05 ($611) – 2020-04-10 ($6877) – 11.26 – 1273 days
    Cycle 4: 2020-04-10 ($6877) – 2024-10-24 ($68155) – 9.91 – 1658 days
    Cycle 5: 2024-10-24 ($68155) – ? – 10 – 81 days so far

Remarkably, in no cycle have we failed to recover to f10 in the last stage, and this is the main reason why we can expect this cycle to be no different.

What changes though, is time required to do it.

Although duration of cycle 4 of 1658 days seems alarming, we actually reached f10 price during recovery by day 1424 – still under 4 years.  Additionally, cycle 4 was notoriously ahead of cycle 3 in timing at the cost of cycle 3 duration decrease and cycle 4 duration increase. Assuming cycle 4 early bull run was a random artifact and time-to-f10 should increase gradually, let’s shift time-to-f10 for cycles 3 and 4 to follow linear growth:

    Cycle 2: 1295
    Cycle 3: 1273 + 58 = 1331
    Cycle 4: 1424 – 58 = 1366

We can also extrapolate time-to-f10 for cycle 5 if we continue that linear growth:

    Cycle 5: 1366 + 35 = 1401

Given this duration, we can predict cycle 5 date of recovery to f10, by adding 1401 days to cycle start date:

    Cycle 5: 2024-10-24 ($68155) – 2028-08-25 ($681550)

The consistent tenfold increase in Bitcoin price over the last three cycles disproves the theory of diminishing returns. What actually diminishes is the bottom-to-top range, which is difficult to time anyway. I would take a guaranteed and easily timed 900% return every 4 years over better bottom-to-top returns any day. The fact that time-to-f10 increases every cycle by a month and cycle length increases by a few months doesn’t look like a big concern for now as long as increase remains linear. Cycle length increase is expected due to the increasing market cap.

The last remaining question is the alignment of the current cycle on the chart with respect to other cycles. Obviously, we don’t know when will we shoot past 1.4y in this bull run so we cannot align it precisely yet. Using definition of cycle start as a point when the price moves past approximately 0.6y for the last time gives us a few days’ leeway. It is tempting to choose 2024-10-24 as the day of cycle start for now, because it gives unbelievably good fit to the last cycle: https://imgur.com/a/ZlKYCF3

Cycle 5 mirrors cycle 4 over the last 104 days with a correlation of R^2 = 0.93, but with less volatility.

Now that we supposedly know where we are, here are some predictions:

1. We are 81 days into the 210 days of the first stage, the first boss fight is 39% complete and its health bar is already at 61%.
2. We will cross the point of no return at 140K in 129 days on May 22.
3. Barring China ban and assuming we sustain cycle 3 and cycle 4 growth rate, we will reach 1M in another 210 days on December 18.
4. Hopefully, we will peak at 1.337M, so I can win the [Guess The High](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hr2ybo/2025_guess_the_high_contest/) contest.
5. We fill not fall below 150K in the bear market.
6. We will recover to 680K on August 25, 2028.
7. Cycle 6 will start a few months later with a target of 10M.

Every good theory must be falsifiable, so what benchmarks can we observe?

If stage 1 lasts two times longer, say 400 days, or we don’t shoot past 140K but start fighting it instead, I’d be concerned.

If we observe exponential rather than linear time-to-f10 growth in this and next cycles, both this theory and Bitcoin will be dead.

P.S. One can argue for an existence of a channel in the first stage, if you ignore cycle 2 wicks (is it even legal to do a TA on a cycle comparison chart? lol): https://imgur.com/a/2Xzgzq2

Channel bottom is currently at 75K.",68

I'm pulling for you to win the Guess the High contest.",14
BTC,2025-01-14,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Big Round Numbers Theory...,"In the words of Peter Venkman, ""well for your sake, I hope you're right"".  

This is all definitely interesting and I'm trying to give it a fair shake.

Some of it ""seems"" arbitrary.  You admit, its based on a 10x theory, then it's all lined up to match up with the 10x theory, correct?

It ""bothers"" me that from 6xx to 6,xxx, we actually went to like 19k that cycle, but your theory is forced to ignore that since you were ""only"" looking for the 10x mark.  (which of course makes sense, since its a 10x theory).  Almost like the 6,xxx to 19,xxx meant nothing?  Yet from 6,xxx to 6x,xxx, we barely went to 68,xxx that cycle.  It would stand to reason that even if you're correct, we'd barely hit 6xx,xxx this cycle, no?.  Not above 1m.   So you're putting ALLOT of faith that the ""10x math trumps all of the other weird theories and math(s) occurring.""  

It doesn't feel like coincidence for example, that we went from 69k to 15,xxx bear market low, it ""kind of"" lined up with the previous cycle high of 19k.  Then we hung around this 60k to 72k range for like 9 months in 2024, which was the previous cycle high?  

Just a disclaimer, I read this in good faith, and would love a response.  I give you credit for putting your predictions out.   This is definitely a one of a kind theory, and I never heard it laid out like this.  Probably most similar prediction is PlanB's STF model?  

I promise that if we hit 6xx,xxx in 2025, I'll come back here beg forgiveness.",10

BTC,2025-07-05,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: [Altcoin Discussion] - July 2025...,"HIP-3 is going to be a game changer not just for Hyperliquid, but for all of crypto. It will, in my opinion, massively ""expand the pie"".

Imagine being able to long or short (with leverage) literally any asset or price feed in the world. Or, imagine being able to create entirely new markets based off of public feeds and data.

Think about that for a second. Think of all the public and private price feeds available today. Anything that has a feed of data can be traded on Hyperliquid as a perpetual market once HIP-3 goes live.

* You can long or short the Nasdaq, S and P, DJIA, or any stock in the world. This is low hanging fruit. And tbh, kinda boring imo. Go to next bullet point.
* Weather-based indexes that use public/private data to create new markets. California Fire Risk Index, Hurricane Season Intensity Index, New Delhi Pollution Index, Snowfall in Russia Index, etc. Any climate data can be traded as a perp.
* Sports data to go long/short your favorite athletes or teams. Esports Viewership Index, NFL Passing Yards Index, etc.
* Video game based data to create indexes like CounterStrike Skin Indexes, Fortnite Skins Index, Minecraft Daily Active Users Perp, etc.
* Real Estate Indexes. Go long/short NYC real eastate, Italy real estate, etc.
* Commodities and energy indexes. Go long/short corn, coffee, oil, uranium, whatever.
* And many, many more that we can't even imagine today.

ALL of this is going to run through Hyperliquid, because Hyperliquid is the largest, most efficient perp dex in the world, and with HIP-3, the ""listing process"" will be completely flipped on its head. The market is going to come *to* Hyperliquid to list the perp indexes they want to trade.

All of this locks up $hype and only further increases the protocol's automatic buybacks. You are not bullish enough on HIP-3 and you are definitely not bullish enough on $hype.

You heard it here first. Hyperliquid has a real shot at being ""The House of All Finance"".

BTC,2025-07-07,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: [Altcoin Discussion] - July 2025...,"I would encourage everyone to look into Hedera $HBAR, the leading network for mass enterprise adoption of DLT (and it’s not even close)
You literally cannot make a better distributed consensus algorithm than Hashgraph (invented in ~2015). I’m talking on a physical level, the way the computers send information to each other and come to consensus, it’s already maxed out. Period.

Bytes sent between nodes is already at the absolute minimum, with maximum speed, while consensus is also achieved in seconds without sending any additional messages. It also has the literal highest possible security for distributed systems, being the first algorithm in the world to achieve asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT) at scale which means it is completely leaderless - immune to DDoS attacks and MEV exploits. No other networks have this (BFT is a huge downgrade and not at all the same, as it is not leaderless)

Don’t call these buzzwords without first doing your research - these are all real things which are required for actual mass enterprise adoption of a smart contract platform.

I recommend watching the YouTube video ‘Leemon at Harvard’ to learn about the tech. It’s the gold standard. Can’t link it here, though 

Happy to answer any questions. Hedera is the 0.01% of alts which will survive and thrive, for many reasons in addition to what I stated above.",0

No buybacks, no burns, nothing. Therefore, what drives *actual* value to $hbar beyond your buzzwords? Nothing. (Though I'm sure you'll come up with some ""institutions will need to hold it!"" BS- which let's be honest, join the line because every coin says that these days.)

The long term chart against USD looks bad (obvious lower highs) and even worse against BTC (nearing all time lows). If you can't outperform BTC, there's really no point in buying the coin anyways. You're better off simply buying BTC. Many shitcoiners have learned this lesson the hard way, cycle after cycle. Why hold a coin and watch it bleed out against BTC? Smh

Lastly you're literally getting dumped on by not just one, but numerous VCs- Blocktower, DCG, and many more. $hbar has had numerous VC funding rounds.

More usage = natural sustained price appreciation, and as I said they are the leaders for enterprise adoption in this nascent market, so once things really kick off (such as finally seeing regulatory clarity), it’s off to the races 

Let me ask you an honest question to see where we stand. Do you believe smart contract DLTs have legitimate use cases and will be adopted by enterprises on a large scale? Why or why not? If we disagree on this fundamental point, I don’t think the conversation can go much further.

If we agree, I would ask you to think one step further on what kind of requirements enterprises have for public DLT and whether any chain besides Hedera meets those requirements

BTC,2025-01-01,post,BitcoinMarkets,El Salvador Trip Report,"Keeping this out of the daily because it’s not strictly market-related, but wanted to post it here on this sub because some of you may find it helpful, and because it’s my Reddit home (at the risk of sounding corny) …

Just got back from a week in El Salvador with family including kids. Here’s my report:

BITCOIN:

- Bitcoin use was hit or miss. I offered to pay our driver in Bitcoin, but he wanted a 25% premium due to volatility. I ended up sending it Western Union (which was a pain in the butt), and paying the remainder in cash. Another person I met said their driver preferred payment in Bitcoin though - he found his driver through a Bitcoiner / Salvador person on X, which seems like a good option for contacts in the country. And I spoke with a hotelier in a rural town (Suchitoto) who has a German elderly couple that’s been staying there for a year and a half and pays in Bitcoin. Much more Bitcoin adoption in El Zonte (Bitcoin Beach), but we didn’t go there. We stayed in quiet areas and visited cities and I hardly saw any Bitcoin adoption to be honest. Still room for growth for sure.

- Downtown San Salvador on Christmas Day had a Christmas Market, and part of it was sponsored by Tether. Big Tether and Bitcoin symbols all over the display. Interesting.

COUNTRY OBSERVATIONS:

- It’s incredibly safe. Walked around town at night, left doors unlocked, belongings unsecured on the beach, zero problems. Lots of police and military around city centers and tourist sites. Biggest vices I saw were a few drunk dudes lounging outside the liquor store waiting for it to open in the morning in a rural town, one guy smoking a cigarette, and one guy with a Michael Jordan 23 tat lol. I would not hesitate to come here with my family again. Zero safety concerns.

- Almost zero tourists here. We were the only non-Salvadorans on our plane coming and going, and were met with “Gringo gringo” more than a few times lol. Saw maybe 5 American families our whole stay touring all around the country, and very few other tourists. We were in Costa Rica in the spring, and I thought “man this would have been awesome 20-30 years ago before the hordes of tourists came”. El Salvador is Costa Rica 20-30 years ago.

- The country is beautiful. I’m tempted to move there to be honest. Gorgeous beaches with crystal clear water and black sand, volcanoes, lakes, mountains, Mayan ruins. Beautiful architecture in the old parts of cities and towns. Delicious food. Frankly it’s a paradise untouched by tourism. 

- Because it is untouched by tourism, some things feel a bit third-world. No flushing your toilet paper. Driving is crazy. Trash in the alleys and gutters of cities. Horses on the beach. Stray dogs everywhere. If you are a resort-type person, go to Costa Rica. If you like authenticity, El Salvador is perfect. I loved it. My boomer mom would have been mortified. To each their own.

- Bukele is extremely popular, and I understand why. Our driver was constantly pointing out areas that used to be controlled by gangs. You couldn’t drive thru certain areas without paying a bribe. You couldn’t go to some areas at all without being robbed or killed. The gangs ruled every aspect of life and commerce. Now they are totally gone. Easy for foreigners to judge his methods from our comfortable homes, but the Salvadorans who aren’t criminals can finally live their lives. I may have bought a t-shirt with Bukele’s giant face on it. I’m a fan, for now.

- Lots of investment from China building new tourism sites, the new library in San Salvador, bridges and infrastructure. I’m wary of this due to Africa’s experience, but it’s El Salvador’s business not mine.

- Coming from the US, prices are cheap. Like 50% of what I would expect to pay at home. Costa Rica was more expensive than US, El Salvador is super cheap. Pupusas $2. Frozen pina coladas $3-4. One-hour boat tour of the lake $25 for 8 people. If you’re considering ExpatFIRE, El Salvador should be on the list.

- The people are incredibly welcoming and warm. Almost no English speakers, so some Spanish is a must (can hobble by on Google Translate). Having people thank you for visiting their country is a nice feeling, and high contrast to somewhere like Europe. Lots of smiles and efforts to be helpful. Street vendors were not aggressive at all. 

- Sites visited: San Salvador, Playa San Blas, Surf City / Libertad, Sunzal beach, Tazumal ruins, Santa Ana volcano, Lake Coatapeque, Boqueron, Tamanique waterfalls, Suchitoto, Devil’s Door. 

I think that’s all. To sum it up - awesome experience and will go back again. Bitcoin adoption still has a long way to go. 

Happy to answer questions or DMs. 

Edit: Forgot to mention that the currency is the US dollar, which makes it super simple for Americans - no currency math for each transaction, and no changing money or trying to spend the last of it before coming home.",80

BTC,2025-01-01,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: El Salvador Trip Report...,"Commenting to add one more thing that I remembered. Our house manager said that the Visa process is somewhat intense. He is coming from Canada, so I don’t know if it is origin country specific. But for him, he said that to get temporary residency, you need to live there for three years, almost full-time, nine months plus per year. And during that temporary residency period the authorities do drop in inspections at any time to make sure that you are living according to the agreement of your visa - number of people in the household, kids receiving schooling, etc. And you have to be employed by a Salvador owned business, or self-employed with documentation. 

The authorities are very strict during this time, and he knows at least a couple of people who had their temporary residency revoked because they didn’t have their documents in order proving everything they needed to, or they were violating something agreed to in their visa. He came to Salvador working remote for a Canadian company, which was fine apparently, but then was fired and had to find a job working for a Salvadoran locally. He now works as an Airbnb manager during his temporary residency.

After the three year temporary residency period, you are eligible for permanent residency, which lasts two years until you are eligible for citizenship. During permanent residency, the requirements are much less stringent, and you can come and go much more freely.

He did say that an alternative to all of this is a golden visa of some sort, where you need to invest $1 million plus to receive it. He didn’t know the details of this because that’s not the route he took. But it is available to high net worth individuals.",6

BTC,2025-01-01,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: El Salvador Trip Report...,"Our driver did say there were a few areas with lots of construction and wealthier buyers. One area we drove thru in San Salvador he said house prices were $1 million plus, which is a ton by ES standards. All had gates.

Would I consider living in those? Not sure. I definitely would prefer a step up from the basic ES house - corrugated tin roof and dirt floors were common. Newer AirBnb homes are gorgeous modern and concrete and really meld the outdoors and the in. I would like something like the latter. Our AirBnb manager said if you are not directly on the beach, you probably want to be up in the mountains. The temperature difference with elevation was huge. Cool breezes were a must, and we were there in the cool season. He said the hot season is pretty humid and brutal with the concrete walled homes and no air flow.

My preference would be to rent a new home on the beach. Area doesn’t matter so much, they’re all safe. But if you want “nicer” areas then El Sunzal was more upscale, and El Tunco, and probably the area around Bitcoin Beach (El Zonte). I likely wouldn’t buy because I don’t trust foreign governments to honor expat land rights - they could revoke it at any time.",6

1. Coinbase is selling pickaxes during the gold rush. They do billions in volume even on down days. Doesn't matter the coin, doesn't matter the direction. The volatility has been excellent for their revenues. 

2. $COIN is going to be the first stock officially issued on chain, likely on Base. This will open it up to even more buying capital. 

3. Coinbase absolutely crushed their Q4 earnings report and have reportedly hired 1,000 new people. 

4. They are the main custodians of all major BTC ETFs, and if a BTC reserve really starts coming into the work, could see themselves as the *trusted custodian of the US government.* This one is a bit more speculative but there are signs pointing to this.",9

BTC,2025-01-19,post,BitcoinMarkets,Post Emergency Analysis PSA: What went right and wrong (but mostly wrong) when I thought evacuation was imminent.,"This is a tale of a dry run for an emergency-driven backup plan for a btc wallet. When it was happening, however, I did not know it was only going to be a dry run, and so it felt more like a descent into hell. But note: [As I mentioned in my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hxwvz9/comment/m6fuo5a/), everything turned out OK, the fire guys did astounding work, and there was ultimately no danger to us or our home. I’m recounting the tale only so that some of you might benefit from our experience. 

Let me give you the punchline first: Your backup plan cannot be independent of a general life plan. You need to consider some pretty far out edge cases. I’m sure many of you have done that, but it is worth taking 10 minutes to double check your plan against my story to test the robustness of your plan. If you don’t want to read a wall of text, skip to the bullet summary at the bottom. 

My story of descent into hell starts with my wife and I out for a small nearby hike. At the very end of the hike, I thought I smelled smoke but assumed it was because of the big LA fires just a few miles south of us (these are the ones you have seen on the news.) It turns out that the smoke was probably the beginning of the new Kenneth fire. Shortly after we got home, there was a large plume of smoke and then it was clear this was a new fire. The winds were high and most of the fire fighters were working on the big LA fires so it was hard to know how it would evolve. Within about 10 minutes, we got an “evacuation warning” on our cell phones.  In the language of public emergency messages “evacuation warning” means pack up and get ready to leave, while “evacuation order” means get out and go now.

 As it turns out, we had a written list of items to pull together for evacuations, so I pulled that out and started working through the list as calmly as I could manage. When I got to the wallet thumb drive, I went to where it was supposed to be and my heart sank: It was not there. Around this time, the sheriff drives by with a bullhorn and I thought he was telling us to evac now. At this point, I am relieved that I have a backup drive with a relative far away, because my wife has a number of medical issues and reduced mobility, so I just don’t have time to figure out why my thumb drive is not where it is supposed to be.  I gather up a few more things and head out to the car and make sure the wife is ready, because for all I know this is the last time we see our house before it joins the many smoldering ruins that we’ve seen on the news. 

Now it turns out (thank all the gods) that this was as far into hell as we descended. The actual end of the story went like this: I went outside, and my neighbors were talking to a firefighter. He told us that as long as the winds did not shift, we would likely not have to evacuate, which meant that I had misunderstood what the sheriff driving around with a bullhorn was saying.  (The sheriff was making sure that everyone knew we should prepare to evacuate in case they missed the cell phone message, and the key thing that I misheard is that people *who need a lot of time* should go now.) The fire then grew to about a 1000 acres before it was officially stopped. I will never let a fire fighter buy his own drink from now on. 

However, just before going outside and learning that we were probably going to be OK, there were about a million thoughts racing through my head about how inadequately I had prepared for the possible endings. Now, I thought I was prepared (I had a list! I had a portable backup drive!) but what was most missing from my emergency planning: For a long-time hodler, life is going to change. Your spouse might develop a serious medical issue, and your parent might start showing signs of dementia. You might need to take care of an injured spouse during evacuation, and you will have precisely zero time to allot to your wallet backup plan, because (trust me on this): What is ultimately important becomes screamingly obvious during such moments, and it turns out that btc is not at the top of your list. 

Memorizing passphrases etc is good and all, but you are going to age too. You may suffer an injury in the disaster you are escaping from and you yourself will start experiencing memory loss. So whatever password is only in your head? Definitely rethink that strategy.

That drive you left with an aging parent? They did not know (or did not remember) that you thought it was important. They are preparing to sell their home and downsize, so it went into the trash. (This was roughly true in my case, as I found out later that week. *That* would have been a bad surprise.)

How about where you are going to escape to? Cell phone service was essentially dead. There are bars on the phone (the cell towers are active) but within certain cells you cannot get data or a phone call out. I hope that 911 service was still there (I sure as hell wasn’t going to test it without an actual emergency, those guys were full of them already) and that is why the cell service was alive at all. So you will need some type of offline map. You may think you know the roads, but imagine everyone in your area leaving: Do you know the side roads? How far away?  As you probably heard, there were cases were folks needed to walk away from their cars. This happened because those particular roads were funnels with no productive side streets to utilize. [In one report](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/residents-evacuate-and-flee-as-palisades-fire-grows/), LAFD told people to get out of their cars to escape the flames and then the fire depts bulldozed them out of the way, and [in another](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfire-windstorm-01-07-25#cm5n82fuo00003b6m6dg9oc1x) report, folks considered heading to the beach in order to escape the flames. 

There is even the case that you are not allowed into your home: When coming back from the hike, I already smelled the smoke. But a little while later, and our path would have been blocked. Does your backup plan include geodiverse recovery? It very much needs to. 

To give you a sense of the blindness that will occur as you are trying to calmly exit and not panic: My backup USB was just a little further down on the shelf. It is now part of a go-bag that I will keep and review every N months (N=6? I think), so that there is one less item to grab. 

So in summary, there are three cases:

* When you are away and your house evaporates for some reason: Have a geodiverse backup, independent of people if possible.
* When there is no time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/), btc backup should be in it.
* When there is time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/) with your btc backup, have a written list of other things to pack. The top of the list should be things you grab first in case you don't have time to grab them all.",35

Did you put a thumb drive in there? Was it able to withstand the temperature (even though it did not burn up?) How temperature-stable is the ink on your paper? or the paper itself?

The root of the problem is something like [this nyt article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html): 

>“All of the major national banks would prefer to be out of the safe-deposit-box business,” said Jerry Pluard, the president of [Safe Deposit Box Insurance Coverage](https://safedepositboxinsurance.com/), a small Chicago firm that insures boxes. “They view it as a legacy service that’s not strategic to anything they do, and they’ve stopped putting any real focus or resources into it.” He estimates that about half of the safe deposit boxes in the country are empty.

>The number of bank branches in the United States has been steadily declining — [down 10 percent in the last decade](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/february/why-banks-shuttering-branches) — and safe deposit boxes are being relocated, evicted and sometimes misplaced.

So I should emphasize the *geodiverse* part of geodiverse backup. Assume that whatever earthquake or fire or flood or <insert disaster here> destroys your locally based backups, and there should be another one a thousand miles (or more) away.",7

6. **Included with your guess must be the instruction ""higher"" or ""lower"". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $99900, but $99900 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your ""higher or lower"".)**
7. Guesses will be accepted until 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 UTC.
8. You must submit an actual number, not ""Whatever the open is on 1 Jan"".

BTC,2025-05-20,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: AMA # 77 - AMA#77 with David Bailey CEO Nakamoto +...,"What is the ultimate end goal for Nakamoto? Is S&P 500 inclusion part of the company's goals overall?

What are his thoughts on crypto-oriented companies and entities working together to speculatively attack S&P 500 inclusion and a higher allocation % within the S&P, to obtain more passive flows for publicly traded Bitcoin treasury companies, like MSTR? 

In September or December, many companies and entities can collaborate to increase the price of BTC, thus the NAV for the bitcoin treasury companies, thus the stock price and market cap of the bitcoin treasury companies, thus a higher % allocation within the S&P 500.  Higher % allocation within the S&P 500 means more passive flows going to buy MSTR from the passive index funds for a quarter.   

Rinse and repeat going into the next quarter close, and quarterly forever. 

Digital asset companies are the only companies on earth which can do anything meaningful to drastically change their market cap within a 4 day period or week period (between potential S&P inclusion announcement on a Tuesday, and passive index funds buying the following Monday). 

Imagine MSTR increasing by 25% ($30B) overnight upon S&P inclusion announcement, like Coinbase, and MSTR issues a Convertible Bond for $30B, buy BTC, BTC soars, then hammer their ATM by $30B, and buy another $30B of Bitcoin.  Debt:Assets ratio would remain intact.  What would happen to BTC's price in a $60B bid over the course of a week?

The other BTC treasury companies would benefit from the increase in BTC price. With enough earnings and market cap, they could be considered for S&P inclusion the following quarters. More passive flows boosting stock price.   

Everyone would benefit. 

The below post does a great job of in depth analyzing this potential for September or December for MSTR and S&P500 inclusion.

BTC,2025-05-21,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: AMA # 77 - AMA#77 with David Bailey CEO Nakamoto +...,"I have been following bitcoin treasury companies closely and love the trend. Thanks for doing this AMA.

1. I know MSTR has relatively little debt (mostly ATM offerings over convertible notes), so the risk of them forced-selling all of their BTC at any point is extremely low. That being said, other bitcoin treasury companies might take more debt and perhaps too much risk. Do you think this could become a problem in the future and how will you assess this risk for Nakamoto (long-term)?

2. AFAIK, the unique point of Nakamoto is that you want to build bitcoin treasuries all over the world. How will that benefit Nakamoto holders, would Nakamoto as a company hold shares of these new worldwide bitcoin treasury companies? And will Nakamoto have direct interest in what has been accomplished with UTXO?",3

BTC,2024-11-24,post,BitcoinMarkets,Selling at 100k?,"Hi Guys,

I’m thinking of selling at 100k. But since there so many sell orders at 100k. I’ll probably sell it at 99k.

When BTC hit 100k, I’m assuming there going to be so many mainstream media news.

Problem is I think it going to hit 100k, then dip and I buy it at a lower price. 

Or do you think it going to hit 100k and still go up do to the market news craze. ",0
BTC,2024-11-24,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Selling at 100k?...,"Yeah that’s the problem isn’t it. Say it hits $100,000 and dips to $95,000. You’re thinking you’re a genius, and you’ll wait until it hits 90. But the next day it’s 105,000. Now you shit your pants and buy at 105,000 and over the next week it drops to 80,000. I’ve thought a lot about this and the best plan is to hold through it all.",11

BTC,2024-11-24,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Selling at 100k?...,"There’s one thing I’ve learned about the market in the 8 years I’ve been in it:
You never predict correctly and the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

If you think Bitcoin goes north of 100k, keep it. If you think it’ll bounce off of 100k and stay lower for months: sell. Just don’t panic when the market does the opposite, the panic is what costs you money.

Everyone and their dog believes Bitcoin will bounce hard off of $100k, so it will probably break through much quicker than everyone thinks.",5
BTC,2024-11-25,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Selling at 100k?...,"Prediction: BTC price will range sideways until Trumps inauguration in January. It will then shoot up to 120k. So to make money in this market: sell at 99400 and buy again at 97000 repeat until January 20th, then HODL hard.",3

Hashgraph represents a breakthrough in decentralized computing, being the most efficient and secure consensus algorithm possible based on our current knowledge of computer science (not an exaggeration). It's a completely leaderless consensus with no bottlenecks, no taking turns, absolutely minimal internode communciation, and aBFT security. It is highly resistant to DDOS attacks and other malicious activity, frontrunning other transactions is impossible (no MEV), and fair timestamps are guaranteed. Fees are very cheap and fixed in USD.  Further, it's literally the only network that has been tested at scale by enterprise usage, having done more transactions than the rest of crypto combined with 71b. 

Whichever smart contract ledger wins the enterprise market will win it all and bless you with generational wealth. Hedera is the clear leader here. Happy to answer any questions.

BTC,2025-05-13,post,BitcoinMarkets,BSR Funding strategy thoughts -- Revenue Neutral ?,"Hey BTC Markets --

This is really more trading adjacent so...
I have been thinking a bit about the BSR and how it could be funded in a revenue neutral way.
 
The thought is to fund the BSR via BTC owners directly selling BTC to the government (via treasury direct), and getting a t-bill (or maybe a BSR T-Bill?).

If they made it tax advantaged in some way ... like it was a tax free conversion ... or a portion of the long term capital gains for the purchase could be deducted at some favorable level, I bet they would get significant interest.  Heck.. ""normal"" folks might buy BTC just to sell it to the treasury to get some BSR-Bills.

I think I first raised this idea in early march in:
https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1j3vgjn/daily_discussion_wednesday_march_05_2025/mg6ceps/ 

But... wondering what do you all think?
Do you think this would this be considered revenue neutral?
Would you consider selling to the USG for some short duration TBills?

I probably would sell some if it had a tax sweetener.",4

BTC,2025-02-06,post,BitcoinMarkets,"""This time is different""","[Link to original post I made almost 8 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5vdiv3/longterm_pattern/)

Since mid-2014, I've maintained a personal chart for Bitcoin's historical price.  Even at that time, it was interesting to me to see similar trends in stability followed by quick jumps in price.  Perhaps this is Elliott Wave behavior?

[Anyway, I thought I'd share the updated chart](https://imgur.com/a/wduAnox)

The blue line is the price history.  For the red line, it's a rough trace of the first box.  For the third and subsequent boxes, it's about 60% residual height to show some decay over time.  Today, you see quite a bit of this stuff with explanations related to halving cycles, so perhaps this doesn't need too much explanation for people these days.

My point for posting today, is that so many people are caught up with recent news as it relates to Bitcoin.  People have almost always tried to create a narrative around WHY Bitcoin is moving up or down in recent days.  Yes, current events and the actions of larger participants in the ecosystem will have some impact on the charts (MtGox, FTX, US SBR).  And those impacts will cause deviations in the pattern.  But the larger picture is the *almost* inevitable march forward on the curve.  ZOOM OUT!  If SBR happens soon, maybe we get a peak this year.  If not, maybe Apple or a large group of companies start the next stage rolling.  Either way or any other way, it still appears to be fairly early in this cycle.

For those interested, [link to my thoughts on why this behavior exists](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7zhhky/update_on_longterm_pattern/duoc0vp/)

While I still keep an eye on Bitcoin cycles, the constant volatility has made me rethink my approach over the past year. Instead of chasing swings, I’ve been focusing more on passive income through private credit lending.

The idea is simple—while BTC and other assets experience ups and downs, private lending lets me earn a stable yield backed by real-world borrowers. That’s why I’ve been looking into platforms like Kasu, which optimizes risk-adjusted yields for private credit in Web3. If the market pumps, great. If it chops, at least I have a reliable yield coming in.

Zooming out is key, but so is diversifying. Curious if anyone else has been exploring private credit alongside their BTC strategy?",1

BTC,2025-04-06,post,BitcoinMarkets,I Built an AI to Signal Crypto Futures Trades—Here's How the First Trade Went!,"Hey r/BitcoinMarkets 

Just wanted to share something cool I've been working on. I built an AI-powered signal for crypto futures trading. The idea was simple: tap into the incredible intelligence of advanced LLM models and let them guide my crypto trades. I've been feeding these models tons of crypto data, fine-tuning them specifically for market moves. To avoid bias from any single model, I'm actually using multiple cutting-edge LLMs and combining their predictions into one solid trading signal. All process are systematic.

Why crypto futures? Honestly, mainly because shorting is straightforward, making it easier to act quickly on signals.

Here's a debut signal I put out yesterday—check it out if you're curious: [https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal](https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal)

It accurately called a short on Bitcoin with exact entry, stop-loss, and take-profit points. I took the trade, and it turned out nicely. Of course, it's still early days, and whether there's consistent alpha here will take more testing and validation. Just thought I'd share what I'm up to and maybe get your thoughts!

Cheers!

They're sheep. All genuinely novel things face harsh criticism when they emerge (and should), just like Bitcoin in the early days. But maybe since this is a Bitcoin sub, my comment will actually generate some discussion. If you'd rather skip this post and just read the whitepaper, go to the bottom.**TL;DR: There is a new month old project out that in my opinion is the first genuinely novel thing to come out in crypto in a long** **time.** Yea yea, I know, your probably thinking ""said every shitcoiner, ever."" Just hear me out...

Bigcoin (ticker $BIG) came out a month ago. In a nutshell, Bigcoin is the world's first fully onchain mining system that actually replicates Bitcoin-style tokenomics. No other project in the world has done this before in a fully transparent, smart contract-based way. Bigcoin is the first. Code is open source [here](https://abscan.org/address/0x09ee83d8fa0f3f03f2aefad6a82353c1e5de5705#code). The developer is someone (or a group?) who goes by the name ""Bigtoshi"". No one knows who they/it is. Completely anonymous. Does this sound familiar?

Now if that doesn't tickle your fancy, then just stop reading. Or, you can read the whitepaper [here](https://www.bigcoin.tech/whitepaper.pdf).

As we all know, in Bitcoin, mining requires physical hardware, electricity, and access to mining pools. In Bigcoin, mining happens 100 percent onchain. You buy miners and facilities, which give you hashpower. Hashpower then ""mines"" Bigcoins. $BIG is distributed every block based on your share of total network hashpower. 

The emission schedule formulas are also exactly like Bitcoin. You can check yourself. Total supply is capped at 21 million coins. Rewards start at 2.5 BIG per block and halve every 4.2 million blocks (which as of now is approx every 50ish days). 

There are other differences such as a burn mechanism when miners or facilities are bought, but beyond that, not a whole lot different. If you go to Bigtoshi's [twitter](https://x.com/satoshibigmoto), you'll see that he has been absolutely cooking. Totally cracked dev. Pushing new updates and changes constantly. Next one is merge mining, which is, imo, a much fairer and better token distribution mechanism that will require you to put skin in the game (in this case, you'll be able to direct some or all of your hashpower to a newly launched coin. The ""skin in the game"" part is that you probably won't be able to mine $BIG while doing that). 

So on a high level, this is literally digitally simulating the entire real-world experience of mining Bitcoin. I personally think that is cool as fuck and has value. 

Abstract from the whitepaper: 

>Bitcoin is the most iconic and successful cryptocurrency ever created. Its simplicity, fixed supply, and halving-based emission schedule have stood the test of time. This is objectively the greatest token mechanic ever created. Bigcoin is built on this truth. Bigcoin’s mission is simple: to become the most recognized token in the world; it is Bitcoin, but bigger. It takes the exact mechanics that made Bitcoin legendary and scales it with precision and purpose. Bigcoin is launching as the largest token economy on Abstract, the biggest consumer chain. With a fixed supply of 21 million, a halving schedule every 4,200,000 blocks, and a fully onchain mining system, Bigcoin reboots the Bitcoin playbook for a new generation of users.

BTC,2025-03-24,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Trading Crypto!...,"There's absolutely an amount of a gambling part to it. I'd say it's not pure gambling because a deck of cards or a slot machine has no like, structure at all. Pure chance. With crypto for example though if news comes out that you know the market will like them it takes some chance out. It's not 50/50 anymore. Like if the fed says we got new info, 5 rate cuts this year. Everything is looking great. I love BTC! Then you can be pretty sure BTC and all coins will go up. Not straight up maybe but up. Haha. If something is in a clear up or downtrend then there more chance than not you know the direction but for how long is the question. But the above in my mind takes some of the gambling aspect out.

Another part is risk management. Like stop losses hedging trade size etc.. I think this is where most lose it. Myself included at times. But if you have a good system in place like rules to limit your loses and a structure when to go in and out of a trade, then I don't think it's gambling. If I play a slot machine, there's no real risk management. I can limit the amount I gamble I guess but there's no stop losses or hedging option at a casino. If I'm wrong please someone point it out. Lol. 

Most people see it as gambling because if you can put money in a system out of your control and either make 20x or lose it all in the space of perhaps minutes to hours to days. Many see that as gambling. But with a strategy and risk management of some type I think it can tweak the odds. So maybe gambling but instead of 50/50 maybe like 65/35 in our favour. With patience luck strategy and risk management.

Meanwhile the Lummis bill is delusional.

> keeping the current bitcoins as a Treasury Asset 

I don't believe he'll make any instruction to centralise the assets. Departments can be instructed not to sell without being given any guidance on what to do with it. Then later once the world has moved on, they can open back up to sell again.

There will be none of the confusion which the Lummis bill presents about the federal government confiscating all the departments civil forfeiture assets. There would be uproar from the departments if that were to happen.

BTC,2025-03-14,post,BitcoinMarkets,Morning Bitcoin order book update with your coffee,"
Bitcoin continues to move within a medium-term uptrend. We still haven’t reached a proper retest of the lower channel boundary or the trendline.

📊 RSI is sitting at 44, which is a neutral zone, meaning there is no clear directional bias yet. Bitcoin’s price is still being tested against macroeconomic conditions and political factors.

⸻

📉 Order Book & Liquidity Zones:

🔹 Key Support Zones:

✅ $81,800 – $82,000 → Strong buy-side liquidity with over 1,200 BTC in limit orders

✅ $80,500 → Large buy interest with significant limit orders

🔹 Key Resistance Zones:

🚩 $83,200 – $83,500 → ~850 BTC in sell orders

🚩 $84,500 → A major sell wall with ~1,100 BTC

🚩 $87,000 → Massive resistance with ~1,500 BTC in limit sell orders

⸻

🔥 Summary & Key Levels to Watch:

	•	$82,000 is confirmed as strong support, while $84,500 remains the key barrier for upside movement.

	•	If BTC breaks above $84,500, this will confirm an uptrend continuation, likely triggering a spike straight to $87,000.

	•	If BTC breaks below $81,800, we could see a retest of the lower trendline around $76,000 (though this scenario seems less likely for now).

⸻

🎯 Trading Strategy for Today:

📌 If you’re looking for entry zones:

	•	For long-term accumulation: $80,500 – $81,000 looks like the best area to catch a bounce.

	•	For short-term speculation: A breakout above $84,500 could lead to a rapid push toward $87,000.

I’ll be closely monitoring the order book and news flow—if anything changes, I’ll provide timely updates.

💪 Stay strong, we are in this together! Wishing you all a great trading day! 🚀

BTC,2025-03-20,post,BitcoinMarkets,"Bitcoin Morning Update with your coffee | March 20, 2025","
Good morning, friends! Hope you’re enjoying your coffee because today’s Bitcoin price action has been nothing short of intense. Let’s break it down.

📉 What Just Happened?
	•	A sudden drop in BTC price was triggered by a market sell-off of ~900 BTC.

	•	The order book reacted instantly, with major buy support at $85,000 absorbing the sell-off.

	•	Currently, $85,000 has the largest buy wall (~1,500 BTC), and it’s constantly refreshing – likely managed by algo traders and fundamental buyers.

📊 Key Order Book Zones & Market Trend

🔹 Support at $85,000 – strong defense level, keeping BTC in a new range of $85,000 – $86,000.

🔹 Sell wall at $86,000 – this could slow any immediate upside move, leading to further accumulation.

🔹 Liquidity target at $89,000 – yesterday, we failed to reach it, but it remains a key target. BTC might push higher to sweep this level.

📈 Trend & Market Outlook

	•	Bitcoin remains bullish despite this shakeout.
	•	The price action is still inside an ascending channel, meaning the broader trend has not broken.
	•	Sharp liquidations like today are normal in an uptrend, as they are often orchestrated by market makers before the next move up.

🚀 Conclusion: The Uptrend is Intact!

🔸 BTC is still bullish.

🔸 Watch $85K support and $86K resistance – a break above could push us towards $89K.

🔸 Trade smart, stay patient, and let liquidity guide the way.

💰 Wishing you all a profitable day – stay disciplined, and good luck! 🚀",30

BTC,2025-04-03,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: [Altcoin Discussion] - April 2025...,"This is the most important chart I am considering, the total crypto market cap: [https://i.imgur.com/60UimCU.png](https://i.imgur.com/60UimCU.png)

We are at the bottom of the lower line which could mean we go up from here.

If this wedge plays out I can give you numbers. Crypto market cap will rise from 2.6 trillion to around 10.5 trillion, so an x4.

At the same time the bitcoin dominance chart shows the clear emergence of a symmetrical wedge surprisingly with 50% more or less exactly as middle line: [https://i.imgur.com/skKTJHV.png](https://i.imgur.com/skKTJHV.png) The increase to the upper line of that wedge is a 3-year rising wedge that is considered to be a reversal pattern. Thus it is likely we go from here to the lower line of the wedge at around 42.5%.

Now let's take 1 and 1 together.

Assumption 1: Crypto market cap goes to around 10.5 trillion.

Assumption 2: When that happens Bitcoin dominance will be 42.5%.

What will be the consequences? How high will Bitcoin price be? I did the math and it corresponds to around 222,000 USD per BTC. How high some specific altcoins will be can’t be answered, but in general, several altcoins will make a multiple from here. I assume that the best performers just continue to best perform, probably some US coins taking the lead, XRP could flip ETH.

Can we identify some pattern in the Bitcoin chart corresponding to around 222,000 USD?

Yes, we can. We can identify a rising broadening wedge with a possible final touch of the upper line at around that level within 2 months or so: [https://i.imgur.com/h35KSz0.png](https://i.imgur.com/h35KSz0.png) That would mean the rise happens fast and not slow as we match the number around then (of course with some flexibility).

BTC,2025-03-19,post,BitcoinMarkets,"Bitcoin Order Book Update – Morning Coffee Edition | March 19, 2025","

Good morning, traders! 🌞 Today is shaping up to be a high-volatility day with the FOMC meeting scheduled. Expect major liquidity sweeps and potential stop-hunts. If you’re trading, be cautious – avoid unnecessary risks!

🔍 Key Support & Resistance Levels (Order Book Analysis)

🔹 Support Levels (Buy Walls):

	•	$82,500 – $82,000: Around 2,000 BTC in buy orders stacked here.

	•	$81,500: Possible deep liquidity sweep zone before any recovery.

🔹 Resistance Levels (Sell Walls):

	•	$83,500 – $84,500: Roughly 2,000 BTC in sell orders. Strong resistance zone.

	•	$85,000: If broken, the market could quickly spike.

	•	🚨 $89,000: A new major sell wall (~2,000 BTC) has appeared here, which was not previously present. This suggests that if BTC breaks $85,000, we could see a massive squeeze straight to $89K to clear these orders.

🔥 What Does This Mean?
	•	Liquidity Grab Likely: Market makers might sweep liquidity from $80K and $89K before establishing direction.
	•	Limited Downside Support: There’s not much buy-side protection below $82K, meaning price could be more volatile on dips.

🎯 Trading Strategy for Today

	•	Best plays: Look for entries around $82,000–$81,500 and target $84,000–$85,000.

	•	Avoid FOMO trades: Whales and institutions are trapping price in a range and accumulating positions.

	•	Stay disciplined: Today is not the day for reckless risk-taking. Expect heavy wicks and stop-runs!

💰 Bitcoin is strength. Blockchain is the future. Stay safe & trade wisely! 🚀",54

BTC,2025-03-24,post,BitcoinMarkets,"[BTC] Morning Order Book Update — March 24, 2025 | Key Walls, Manual Sells & Q1 Close","
Price: $87,350 
Volume up, CVD +3371 — buyers are in control, stacking pressure near resistance.


⸻

Sell-Side Liquidity:

	•	88,000 — 172 BTC
	•	87,800 — 94 BTC
	•	87,600 — 105 BTC

→ The 87,500–88,000 range is our “red zone” from the chart.

It’s playing out perfectly — but here’s the twist:
We’re not just seeing limit walls. Manual sell orders are being placed aggressively — likely from fund bots trying to cap price and harvest liquidity.

⸻

Buy-Side Liquidity:

	•	86,000 — 1,124 BTC (massive wall)
	•	85,500 — 466 BTC
	•	85,200–84,600 — 100–150 BTC per level

→ Total visible buy-side liquidity: 2,100+ BTC.

Big hands are clearly accumulating.

⸻

What’s Next?

Break above 88K = door opens straight into 92K–94K liquidity zone.
We can already see signs of absorption and potential magnet action toward that level.

⸻

Bonus Context:

We’re approaching Q1 and monthly close.
Funds often want green candles on the chart for investor reports — and that typically means a bullish quarterly finish.

⸻

Grizzly’s short note:

	•	Strong buy wall at 86K — price well protected below
	•	Red zone at 88K acting as friction point — but it’s artificial
	•	Breakout could trigger a fast move to 92–94K
	•	Quarterly close fuel might push us higher

⸻

Sip your coffee, study the walls.

BTC,2025-01-28,post,BitcoinMarkets,Looking for some advice - sell vs collateralized loan?,"Alright I'm looking for some advice here on risk management/strategy.  I figured this sub is best to ask.  I hold some bitcoin and have for like 10 years.  Never sold a thing, had a conviction then, and still have it now.  I expect price will still at least double this year.

  
Problem is right now I need some money, and let's say I need 100k for simplicity.   I could sell 1btc, take the profit quick and simple, but then potentially lose out on \~100k in future gains.  

  
Or, I could put 2btc up for collateral, pay 12k interest, and get 100k loan.  If price doubles, I would be saving 88k in this scenario.  But obviously there is the counterparty risk of losing 2btc.  There's also some risk of liquidation if things go south.

  
I do plan to sell/trade/diversify my stack this year anyhow.  So the cap gains isn't a huge consideration. 

  
What would you do?  Take the easy/simple profit and move on with life,  or let it ride and find/manage a btc backed loan, and try to maximize gains at all costs?  I'm not risk averse, it's how I got here in the first place.  But I want to make the smartest decision.

They have already done more transactions than the rest of crypto combined with no downtime, no congestion, and non-fluctuating fixed USD fees. They are also formally verified to be aBFT secure (highest possible security for decentralized systems), as well as MEV resistant and real finality in 3 seconds (legal finality).

Looks like it's ready to break out in a big way - already moved from rank 52 to 26 in a few days and is now rank 24. I believe it’s headed for top 5 and will shock the crypto market because they don’t realize how much ground work has been laid for real mass enterprise adoption.

I also believe it is one of the most decentralized networks in crypto. A governing council of up to 39 enterprises and organizations on different continents, under different governments, in different industries, all transparently known. Meeting minutes are published. Members are term limited. No single member can consolidate power. This is much more decentralized, secure, and collusion resistant than other crypto networks which are governed by anonymous whales, who are all in the same industry and can consolidate power over time by collecting more coins.

Who is on the governing council? Google, Dell, abrdn (look them up), Australian Payments Plus (look them up too) etc.

On the software development side, they are going for an open source meritocracy based development model and are the first L1 to submit their entire codebase to the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust as founding members.

It's solid advice and I agree with this. In fact, I hold a lot more BTC than I do HBAR (although HBAR is gaining quickly). 


>The only coin with true staying power is BTC, and maybe a few others.

Exactly. What I believe is that Hedera is seeing enterprise adoption at a level no alt coin has ever seen before which puts it into the ""few others"" category. Whoever wins the enterprise market for smart contract DLTs will have significant staying power. 

>A coin could have any number of users, level of mass adoption, or the best tech in the world, but that doesn't always equate to buyer-side demand.

In this case, it *does* equate to buyer side demand. Everything done on the Hedera network is paid for via fixed-rate USD fees, but, a corresponding amount of HBAR is always spent on the backend either directly or indirectly (i.e. you hold the HBAR yourself and spend it or you go through a 3rd party who you pay USD and they spend the HBAR for you). 

There is no scenario in which Hedera sees mass adoption and does not see significant buying pressure from the users.",0

>If the governance council is made up of the same group that has the insider supply (it is), this is not decentralization.


Governing council members (""insiders"") do not receive any significant amount of HBAR. For example, I checked Google's node; they only hold $76k worth of HBAR and I believe those were rewarded from validating transactions. 



You can see the HBAR treasury reports by searching for them. In addition to a portion being used for operating expenses, HBAR were distributed across various decentralized organizations such as the HBAR Foundation, Hashgraph Association, and others, who in turn distribute them to various projects and initiatives over a period of a decade or more. 


If you are implying that GC members are receiving billions of HBAR in secret, I would say that's extremely unlikely. The council is collusion-resistant and not in a place to risk their reputation for a small profit. 

I also disagree with calling them ""insiders"". The ~32 GC members are all transparently known and were voted in democratically by other GC members over a period of 5 years. They are spread across different industries and mostly have no ties with each other; the latest to join is Nairobi Securities Exchange who will be building their entire stock market on Hedera. 

>Also, inflation is even higher than XRP, which is impressive, in that it's hard to be worse than XRP.



HBAR does not have ""inflation"". It has a fixed supply of 50b which will never be increased. Nearly 80% of those have been released into circulation.",0

Inspired by /u/imissusenet 's Guess the Low contest I decided it's now or never to create a Guess the High equivalent for 2025. Here are the rules:

The time window is 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC to 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 UTC.

**What is your guess for the highest price during that window?** (Price is in USD, and comes from Coinbase)


Rules:

1. You get one guess.
1. Guesses must be **messaged to me**, NOT sent as a reply to this post.
1. Guesses must be in $100 increments, in round $100 amounts (i.e. $99900, $165300, etc.)
1. Included with your guess must be the instruction ""higher"" or ""lower"". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $99900, but $99900 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your ""higher or lower"")
1. You must submit an actual number, not ""Whatever the open is on 10th Jan""
1. I reserve the right to toss your entry if you're a pain in the ass about it or don't follow the rules.
1. Guesses will be accepted until 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC

The person with the closest guess will get their choice of **0.0005 BTC or $50 worth of BTC** at the price at the close of the contest. Once all the entries are in, I will post the guesses here. I will include my guess as well.


Rule #4 is a rule, not a suggestion! Include ""higher"" or ""lower""!

BTC,2024-11-28,post,BitcoinMarkets,Is the next 5 years going to be the era of Bitcoin that bucks the previous trends?,"I’m sure everyone on here has seen the various graphs out there showing how the price of Bitcoin has moved over the years and how there is a pattern that is expected to continue - highs and lows and imminent highs after the halving events etc. 

Can anyone foresee a situation where this trend/pattern is broken due to all of the things that have happened and are due to happen? E.g some of the most wealthy and powerful companies in the world getting involved in Bitcoin like Blackrock, the Cynthia Lummis bill that proposes that the US gov purchase 200,000 bitcoins every year for 5 years. And then there is the other stuff that will be good for the crypto industry more generally, Gensler resigning and being replaced with a more crypto-friendly head, companies like Ripple being unshackled after the court case comes to an end. 

There is a lot of positive things happening right now for crypto and due to happen, but will it really be enough to send the crypto industry soaring and establish it as the 12th sector of the S&P500, like Kevin O’Leary has predicted?",13

BTC,2025-03-17,post,BitcoinMarkets,☕ Morning Bitcoin Market Update – Grab Your Coffee & Let’s Dive In!,"

17 March 2025 AM

https://ru.tradingview.com/chart/1CneWjKu/

Bitcoin is following technical levels perfectly, and today’s order book confirms strong liquidity zones.

📌 Key Observation:
For those watching TradingView, we bounced perfectly from the $82,000 buyer zone—a bookmap reaction. I personally entered a position there and will now watch for further reactions at key levels.

⸻

📉 Order Book Breakdown (Bookmap Analysis):

🔹 Buy Orders (Support Zones):

✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC buy orders

✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC buy orders

✅ $82,000 → Strongest buyer wall, ~1,500 BTC

🔹 Sell Orders (Resistance Zones):

🚩 $85,000 → The “mystical zone” of major resistance

🚩 $85,200 → The liquidation point of a massive short position (previously spotted in an earlier post!)

🚩 $87,000 → Strong sell-side liquidity—this is where price could squeeze today

⸻

⚡ Market Outlook & Trade Plan:

	•	If BTC holds above $83,000, a retest of $85,000 – $85,200 seems likely.

	•	Above $85,200, we should see a short squeeze towards $87,000, triggering stop hunts.

	•	Watching for reactions at $85K—if the level gets absorbed, we’re pushing higher.

⸻

BTC,2025-03-22,post,BitcoinMarkets,"Morning Bitcoin Order Book Check with Your Coffee – March 22, 2025","
Let’s dive into the BTC order book while you sip your morning coffee.

Current price range:
We’re sitting between $84,000 – $85,800, and it’s clear this zone is packed with action.

⸻

Order Book Heatmap – Key Levels

Resistance (limit sell walls):

	•	85,800 – 441 BTC
	•	85,700 – 428 BTC
	•	85,600 – 463 BTC
	•	85,500 – 447 BTC

The upper zone is loaded with sell orders. Someone really doesn’t want price to break above — most likely institutional players or funds placing thick walls to keep things capped for now.

Support (limit buy walls):

	•	84,200 – 1,180 BTC
	•	84,300 – 773 BTC
	•	84,000 – ~800 BTC

This is some serious buy-side pressure. These walls look like accumulation zones — big players are scooping up BTC and not letting it fall below this range.

⸻

Trade Flow (T&S):

Most trading activity is concentrated between 84,200 – 84,500 right now.
Lots of small market orders (5–10 BTC) going through — shows a calm but confident market, without panic.

⸻

Market Sentiment:

	•	Order book volume up +23%
	•	Overall supply down -9%

This hints at sell-side orders being slightly pulled back while buyers are stepping in more aggressively. Could be a sign of quiet accumulation.

⸻

TL;DR:

	•	Strong support wall at 84,200

	•	Thick resistance zone up to 85,800

\- Diversify: explore altcoins for potentially stable swing trades.

\- Risk Management: set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels to protect capital.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the way people interact with financial systems, making them more accessible, transparent, and inclusive. At the heart of this ecosystem lies Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), platforms that facilitate peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. Among the innovative tools emerging in this space is ODOS, a cutting-edge DEX aggregator that is changing the game for DeFi users worldwide.

# Bullish Scenario: Adam and Eve Bottom Formation

From a technical analysis perspective, ODOS’s native token (or the broader DeFi market) may be setting the stage for a significant bullish move. The current price action suggests the formation of an Adam and Eve bottom, a classic reversal pattern characterized by a sharp ""V""-shaped bottom (Adam) followed by a rounded ""U""-shaped bottom (Eve). This pattern often precedes a strong wave 3 impulse wave, aligning with Elliott Wave theory.

If this scenario unfolds, we could see a breakout to new highs, leading to price discovery and substantial upside potential. Wave 3 is typically the longest and most powerful of the Elliott Wave cycle, driven by increased investor confidence and strong market momentum. For traders, this presents an opportunity to capitalize on a potentially explosive move while reaffirming the importance of tools like ODOS in executing trades efficiently.

# Conclusion

ODOS stands out as a premier DEX aggregator, providing DeFi users with optimized trading, cross-chain functionality, and access to deeper liquidity. As the blockchain space continues to mature, the importance of DEXs cannot be overstated. They represent the future of finance, enabling a more equitable and decentralized financial system. With bullish technical setups like the Adam and Eve bottom formation, coupled with innovative tools like ODOS, the DeFi market is primed for growth and new price discovery, making now an exciting time for both traders and investors alike.",1
BTC,2025-01-06,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: [Altcoin Discussion] - January 2025...,"Last month, it was announced that Intel and Nvidia are using the Hedera $HBAR network for trust and verification of their AI models. You won't see this covered in the typical crypto media because Hedera is a threat to them, but it's happening.

>Today, EQTY Lab, Intel, and NVIDIA unveiled Verifiable Compute. The new, transformative solution addresses a critical need in the AI industry for trust and verification, particularly as autonomous AI agents become more prevalent.

BTC,2025-01-06,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: [Altcoin Discussion] - January 2025...,"A perfect storm seems to be brewing around Icon (ICX), the native token of the ICON network. Technical analysis indicates a highly promising setup: ICX has been forming a multi-month falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish formation. Combine this with the ongoing political unrest in South Korea, and the likelihood of an explosive price surge becomes ever more imminent.

# Technical Analysis: The Power of the Falling Wedge

A falling wedge is a pattern characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows, with decreasing amplitude. It typically signals a potential upward reversal. ICX has been following this formation since the beginning of this year.

The current situation reveals:

* **The lower support line** has been successfully tested multiple times, indicating that buyers are ready to accumulate.
* **The upper resistance line** is drawing closer, making a breakout likely within weeks.
* **Volume indicators** show declining trading activity within the pattern, a typical characteristic of consolidation before a major move.
* **Key resistance levels** around $0.25 to $0.30 are within reach if the breakout occurs.

Once ICX breaks through resistance, it could accelerate towards $0.50 or higher, representing a significant price increase from current levels.

# Political Unrest in South Korea: Why This Could Benefit ICX

ICON is one of the most prominent blockchain projects in South Korea, with its adoption closely tied to the country’s economy and politics. The recent political turmoil in the country, including protests and uncertainty over government policies, has led to:

* **Increased interest in decentralized technologies**: Citizens are seeking alternatives to traditional systems, making blockchain projects like ICON more appealing.
* **Support from the crypto community**: South Korea hosts one of the most active crypto markets in the world. Unrest often drives a shift towards digital assets as a safe haven.
* **Potential institutional moves**: If policymakers view blockchain as a solution to economic challenges, ICON’s infrastructure could play a crucial role.

# Historical Parallels

In the past, political and economic unrest in South Korea has led to surges in demand for cryptocurrencies. ICON has previously benefited from national adoption campaigns and could see another rally as trust in traditional systems wanes.

# Conclusion: Now Is the Time

The combination of a technically bullish pattern and geopolitical dynamics in South Korea makes ICX one of the most promising assets in the market. Investors who act now could benefit from a potential breakout that appears just weeks, if not days, away. Keep a close eye on the charts and prepare for a potentially explosive move.

BTC,2025-03-13,post,BitcoinMarkets,I built a Bitcoin dashboard that tracks leading indicators and reveals which ones actually work—along with their forecasts,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been frustrated for a while seeing people mention various on-chain metrics, indices, and narratives as if they have clear predictive power — but rarely do I see anyone actually measure and *visualize* how well these indicators perform over time. So [I built a Bitcoin dashboard](https://unravel.markets/pulse) that tracks a bunch of leading indicators and shows which ones are actually working (or not), along with their forecasts. Thought it might be useful for others too.    
  
Would love to hear if this is useful for you aswell!

BTC,2025-01-16,post,BitcoinMarkets,Coinbase vs Fidelity for BTC short term trading,"I have held some BTC in cold storage for multiple cycles. We could see a Bear as usual later this year, or possibly a Supercycle. I have decided to dust off the old wallet and trade my BTC utilizing reliable Technical Analysis. If we have a Bear cycle I should end up with more BTC at the bottom, and if we see a Supercycle my TA should keep me in the game.

My original plan was to move it to a Fidelity Brokerage and trade FBTC, but the problem with that is FBTC only trades 8 hours each day (at best). To do this with more precision I think I need to trade BTC with a Coinbase or with a Fidelity Crypto account.....

I have been backtesting my TA, and I'll do roughly 40 trades over 500 days starting in June.

So 40 trades using either Fidelity Crypto, or Coinbase.

Which would be the least costly?

Which would be more secure?

Thanks a million!",8

BTC,2025-03-12,post,BitcoinMarkets,Quick BTC order book update with your morning coffee,"
Right now, strong buyer volume is concentrated around the support zone at $80,800–$82,000, providing a solid floor. Above our current price (~$82,400), local sellers are stacked between ~$82,800–$83,000, with more significant resistance around $84,000–$84,500.

https://ru.tradingview.com/chart/1CneWjKu/

Here’s the detailed breakdown of key levels from today’s order book:
	•	Strong Support: $80,800–$82,000 (heavy buyer orders)
	•	Immediate Resistance: ~$82,800–83,000 (minor), then stronger at $84,000–$84,500
	•	If we break above $84,500, the road opens towards $87,200 and further up to the $90,500–92,000 zone (Ichimoku Cloud and Fib levels).

Bottom line: Expect decent volatility between $80,800 and $84,500, but the support below is solid. Staying bullish as long as support holds!

Keep the vibes bullish, stay positive, LONG only!
Have a profitable day, everyone!

BTC,2025-01-02,post,BitcoinMarkets,Advice on Investing in Bitcoin: Spot vs. Futures + Modified DCA Strategy,"Hi everyone!

I’m looking for advice and opinions from more experienced investors regarding my current Bitcoin investment strategy. I’m set on using a DCA (dollar-cost averaging) methodology, but with a bit of a twist. Instead of buying regularly at fixed intervals, I accumulate Bitcoin over time and occasionally increase my investment when the market dips significantly.

Currently, I’m using Binance to trade futures contracts and take long positions. My strategy looks something like this:

1. I buy futures long contracts periodically, following a modified DCA approach.
2. I use low leverage, typically 3x, to manage risk.
3. When the market experiences a sharp dip, I increase my investment slightly more than usual to take advantage of the opportunity.
4. When the position reaches a certain percentage of profit (depending on market conditions), I sell and lock in the gains.

The Issue:

I’m worried about the funding fees that come with futures. I understand that these fees slowly eat into my position’s value over time, which means that if I hold a position for too long, a chunk of the profit goes towards these maintenance costs.

My Questions for You:

1. Would it make more sense to switch entirely to the spot market, trade Bitcoin there, and avoid the funding fees? I’m not looking to hold BTC long term—I just want to profit from trading. However, with spot trading, I lose the ability to use leverage, which could limit my returns.
2. Does it make sense to stick with futures contracts and my modified DCA strategy using low leverage (3x)? This approach allows me to grow my position faster and take advantage of leverage, but the funding fees are a concern.

What would you recommend for someone who:

* Trades on Binance and is familiar with the platform.
* Wants to profit from BTC price movements rather than holding it long term.
* Prefers to use low leverage to minimize risks (3x).
* Occasionally increases investments during significant market dips to take advantage of lower prices.
* Is actively monitoring the market and trades regularly.

I’m also curious about your experiences with funding fees and whether anyone has successfully used futures with a low-leverage DCA strategy on Binance. Thanks in advance for any advice!",2

BTC,2025-01-16,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: Advice on Investing in Bitcoin: Spot vs. Futures +...,"Yeah, it's pretty similar to what you mentioned. On Binance, funding rates are calculated every 8 hours. If the market's mostly long, the funding rate goes positive, so longs end up paying shorts. If the market's mostly short, it's the other way around, and shorts pay longs.

During a sideways market with a lot of longs, the funding rate can get pretty high, making it expensive to hold a long position. Over time, that can force people to close their positions, which can lead to a cascade of liquidations. So yeah, the fees can definitely add up if the market stays stuck in one direction for too long.",2

With Binance, though, everything is handled within their system, so you don’t have to worry about generating unique IDs or managing it on the backend yourself. The API gives you access to all your order information, and you can set things like partial closes or trailing stops directly in the platform. That takes away a lot of the manual work.

I drew a line at the valuation's bottom at 6.38 million sats per SPX. When Bitcoin pumped late last fall/ earlier winter, the S&P fell bellow the 6.38 million sats level, but then something interesting happened. This level, which I doubted anyone else was watching, became resistance. Recently, however, as Bitcoin dumped, the level has become support for SPX.

BTC,2025-03-21,post,BitcoinMarkets,"Bitcoin Order Book Update – Morning Coffee Edition  | March 21, 2025","
Looking at the order book, we can see that we are still ranging between two key zones. This means institutions are still holding this area for position accumulation.

📊 Liquidity Breakdown

🔹 Buy Orders (Bids):

	•	$83,600 – $84,000: 930 BTC in limit buy orders.
	•	$84,000 – $84,250: 650 BTC in buy orders.
	•	Below $83,500: Huge liquidity reserves, but no visible cluster of orders.

🔻 Sell Orders (Asks):

	•	$84,800 – $85,000: 1,050 BTC in sell orders.
	•	$85,500: 1,350 BTC, a high concentration of liquidity, possibly market makers positioning.
	•	$86,500 – $88,000: A large amount of stop liquidity is placed. If broken, we can expect a strong impulse move, which I’ve been waiting for all this time. Those stops are still untouched.

⚡ Futures Market & Potential Short Squeeze

	•	Open Interest at $84,250: More than 5,000 BTC held in positions.
	•	Key Liquidity Cluster still above $85,000 → a possible short squeeze scenario.
	•	Balance is shifting towards limit buyers in the $83,600 – $84,000 range.
	•	$84,800 has a large number of sell orders, but market participants may pull them at any moment.

📈 Summary:

✅ $83,600 – $84,000 → Strong Buy Zone (institutional accumulation).

✅ $84,800 – $85,500 → Sell Zone, where liquidity may be collected before a move higher.

✅ $86,500 – $88,000 → Liquidity grab zone, where stops could trigger a squeeze and push us even higher.

📌 As always, manage your risk. Bitcoin remains bullish as long as we trade within this range. Only major news could push us out of this accumulation channel. If we hold this momentum, institutions will likely shift their accumulation zone higher from the current range.

🚀 Stay sharp, the move is coming!",24

What are everyone's thoughts on the rainbow chart? It seems like it does a good job of outlining Bitcoin's cyclical nature. A bull run 1-1.5 years after each halving, followed by a bear market and a bottoming out past year 2 until the next cycle begins.

If this holds true, it seems like we could very much be in range for a 150-200k bull peak in 2025, followed by a retracement back down to 50-100k territory in 2026-2027. Setting us up for a bull run into ~500k territory following the 2028 halving.",5

BTC,2024-10-20,post,BitcoinMarkets,My butt-pulled hypothesis on price action,"We reached all-time high before the halving then piddled around for seven months after. Why? I’ve got reasons. Butt-pulled reasons, but they are reasons. 

This assumes halvings mean something. It also assumes exogenous factors like the 2020 money printing bonanza, 2021 China mining ban, and 2024 ETF approval affect the price as well. 

The 2020 halving happened on 5/11/20. Bitcoin reached a new all time high 219 days later on 12/16/20. It then continued upward until the China ban. 

In 2024, the Bitcoin price was $42,853 on the day the ETFs launched. It piddled around for a bit then rocketed into the fifth dimension in February going past ATH before the halving. **This was because of the ETFs**. THEN, that ran out of steam. It stopped propelling the price into the stratosphere. 

The price fell and rose and fell and rose and piddled around prompting people to declare the #58KGang. The ETFs were enough to keep it above the level it should have been without the ETFs, but they weren’t powerful enough to rocket it anymore. If there were no ETFs, Bitcoin would have gradually gone from $42,853 to \~$64K today with normal Bitcoin variance. 

It’s now 183 days after the 2024 halving. It will be 219 days on 11/24/24. We can expect choppiness until approximately then at which point Bitcoin will resume its upward trajectory. 

Or the hypothesis is malarkey. I said it was butt-pulled. But it did occur to me.",11
BTC,2024-10-20,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: My butt-pulled hypothesis on price action...,"Here’s another take:

ETFs boosted the price above what it should be at this time, and we all seem to agree on this. 

But there also has to be a correction/dip around the halving, which happened. 

Usually the dip is much stronger, but ETFs again came in and didn’t let the price drop too low. 

Now, since there’s much more institutional money coming in, which means people who are much more responsible about buying, they want to buy at a reasonable price. 

They also have deep pockets, so they need to buy a lot. 

Which means they want to keep the price at a reasonable level for as long as they are buying. 

Coincidentally, this also causes a long and healthy consolidation. Which is amazing for the future of BTC. 

And once they are done buying, they’ll stop controlling the rise. And it should fly again. 

The way up will be bumpy, though, as there will be a lot of sell offs, since these same institutions will be looking to exit the market. 

And if you want to exit with such huge funds, you need to do it steadily over time, and at intervals at higher and higher prices, each time causing a dip. 

I also don’t think they’ll let the price go too high up, as they don’t need it to double or triple, if they put in so much money.

They just need like 20-70%. 

So it’s quite possible the new ATH for this cycle won’t go past 120k, maybe even as low as 86k.",9

> They just need like 20-70%.

I disagree on this premise. I think it implies that whatever funds/companies have a nontrivial percentage of their portfolio in BTC and thus would feel the need to derisk sooner, which I highly doubt. More likely the vast majority of institutions in the space are well below 2-3% and that allocation is explicitly categorized as a high risk play with set performance targets.

For example. My hypothetical fund has a 1% allocation with a avg cost basis of 60k. Small enough to potentially write off, but large enough to make an impact if there's high upside. I could sell everything at 90k and lock in a 0.5% gain on the portfolio, or I could wait for a 2-3x which it's done literally every cycle minimum. Laddered sells from 120-180k could knock that overall portfolio gain to ~2.5%, which might be the difference between hitting or missing fund targets if/when other 'safer' investments go south. Perhaps it only barely touches 2x before a longer term downtrend and I ladder sell down making my average sell 90k regardless. Either way the R/R ratio puts the target to the high side.

Riskier institutions with higher allocations are going to be the exception not the rule, they might sell for a 20-70% as you mentioned but I can't imagine the impact being noteworthy given their number. Of course this dynamic will shift over time as the asset becomes less volatile, but in the meantime that's where we are today as far as I can tell.

Thoughts?",3
BTC,2024-10-25,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: My butt-pulled hypothesis on price action...,Agreed with all your points but not with the believe 'they' don't want to see it higher at 200k or 300k  because they are going  to dump it.,0
BTC,2024-10-20,comment,BitcoinMarkets,Comment on: My butt-pulled hypothesis on price action...,">Thoughts?

What you’re saying would make sense if these institutions had like 2-5 BTC, as in such a case you can sell without impacting the market. 

But if you’re holding like 1k BTC and you start selling around the top (let’s imagine for a second that they figure out the top), and all the other smart money start doing that — the market won’t be able to handle such a massive dump, and you will not get your desired top price. 

What you do in turn, is you take the 0.5% portfolio increase (which you hypothesized) and look for another way to put that money to work. 

These institutions go off of strict trading/investing rules. They need for the money to keep working. 

And if they get the money to a -30% on that particular investment, they now need to make it all back, but it’s not easy to find another 30-60% growing asset. (Before BTC cycle comes around, if it even does.)

There’s also the looming financial crisis coming up, where you really want to have money ready to start buying assets. Of course it’s not a given, but the markets sure do look ripe for a crash. 

Anyways, I think it’s a matter of scale. 

At a small scale they could be greedy, but with such huge holdings, they need to be much more pragmatic. 

It’s also a known fact that traders work on strict rules, and they don’t just go: “oh let’s have it run and see what happens.” At least not after they took profit. 

They might do that with like 5% of their total BTC investment. While they decide to hold maybe like 2-10%. But only after they calculated that it’s “free” BTC, on which they already made a lot of money, and have some left over and can afford to let it sit. 

All the rest is getting sold.",1

BTC,2025-03-18,post,BitcoinMarkets,📢 Morning Bitcoin Update with Your Coffee ☕️ 18 March 2025,"**

📢 Morning Bitcoin Update with Your Coffee ☕️

Good morning, everyone! 🌞

Bitcoin remains trapped in the grip of institutional funds – support at $82,500–$82,400, while sell orders keep piling up around $83,000. No major moves yet, as big players continue accumulating positions at these levels, preventing the price from breaking out in either direction.

🔥 The key event ahead? The FOMC meeting on March 19, which will likely dictate Bitcoin’s next major move. Until then, expect sideways action and potential manipulations.

💥 Recent whale action – a $330M short position:
	•	A group of traders attempted a short squeeze, but at $85,100, the whale added margin, pushing liquidation further away.
	•	He eventually closed his position with an $8-9M profit and is no longer in the trade.

What’s next?

🔹 Expect sideways movement in the $82,000–$84,000 range.

🔹 If we break $83,500, the range could shift to $85,000–$86,000.

🔹 Keep an eye on $82,000 – if support disappears, we might see a deeper retrace.

This is a range-bound market, so trade accordingly, stick to discipline, and manage your risk!

💰 Wishing you all a profitable day! 🚀",27
BTC,2024-12-07,post,BitcoinMarkets,Best trading approach/platform to maximize bitcoin instead of usd? The death of bitcoin as collateral...And where to trade with no kyc?,"Life happened and I took a long time off trading, now I'm back to take some leveraged punts on crypto. (yes I'm probably a top signal)

Back in the day inverse perpetual swap contracts that used bitcoin as collateral dominated. It was awesome in bull markets since trading grew your bitcoin stash (hopefully) and your bitcoin stash appreciated all the while (hopefully).

Currently the most popular perpetual swaps are not inverse, and settle in usdt which seems to me a pretty lame concept in a bull market. So to be able to trade you have to sit in usdt?? Eww. I suppose you could always have at least a 1x long open to pretend you're holding spot, but now you're paying funding constantly which seems stupid.

And my uh, trading partner, ahem... is in the US with a VPN and can't use the places that still have inverse swaps with decent volume like bitmex, binance, bybit, since they're KYC exchanges.

So... Are there any non kyc exchanges that offer crypto margined perps with half decent volume? Maybe dex's offer a solution?

BTC,2024-11-22,post,BitcoinMarkets,It's Always a Good Time to Invest,"I’ll admit, I was skeptical about Bitcoin at first. It sounded too abstract, too volatile, and honestly, too good to be true. But over the years, as I’ve watched the financial world evolve and crumble in certain areas, I’ve come to realize something: it’s never a bad time to buy Bitcoin. Let me explain why.

Bitcoin is more than just a digital coin; it’s a hedge. Against inflation, against the instability of traditional markets, against the uncertainties of a centralized financial system that can be manipulated. While governments print money endlessly, eroding the value of every dollar I save, Bitcoin operates on a fixed supply. Only 21 million will ever exist, period. There’s no quantitative easing, no bailouts, no central authority pulling strings. It’s a foundation built on scarcity and trust in the code.

Then there’s the growing adoption. I’ve seen major companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, countries experimenting with making it legal tender, and even my tech-savvy friends starting to take it seriously. These aren’t random trends—they’re signals of a paradigm shift. Every day, Bitcoin inches closer to mainstream acceptance, and I want to be ahead of that curve.

People always say, “But it’s so volatile!” Sure, it can spike or crash in the short term, but zoom out. Look at its history. Over the years, the trend is clear: upward. It’s like planting a tree; you don’t panic over a windy day if you know that tree will bear fruit for decades. The dips? I see them as buying opportunities, not setbacks.

What really gets me, though, is the freedom Bitcoin offers. It’s mine—completely. No bank can freeze it, no government can seize it. I’ve always wanted my money to be just that: mine. Bitcoin gives me that autonomy, and there’s a certain power in knowing I’m part of a decentralized network that transcends borders, time zones, and middlemen.

So yeah, Bitcoin isn’t just an investment to me—it’s a belief in a better way. Whether prices are high, low, or somewhere in between, I’ve realized that buying in is never a bad decision. It’s a vote for financial independence, for innovation, and for a future that I’m proud to be a part of.

BTC,2025-02-25,post,BitcoinMarkets,Bitcoin and Macroeconomics,"Hey everyone, I’ve been a long-term Bitcoin investor and have largely met my return goals by holding. However, after diving deeper into macroeconomics, I believe Bitcoin’s price is heavily influenced by broader economic trends. In the next 6–12 months, I expect economic conditions to deteriorate, with the Fed’s response—especially to inflation and labor market data—determining whether we enter a bull or bear market.

That said, I have two reasons for not selling my Bitcoin:

	1.	A potential federal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) announcement under a Trump administration, which could drive prices up.
	2.	If inflation stays below 3%, tightening liquidity may push the Fed to ease QT, supporting asset prices.

BTC,2024-11-22,post,BitcoinMarkets,Rise/Fall Statistics,"I made a spreadsheet with the closing prices of BTC every day since 1/1/2018 to perform some analysis on the data. Mostly for fun, because predicting how the market goes is a complete gamble, but I found my results an interesting find. Maybe others will point out the flaws or maybe it's more interesting than I think 🤷🏻 but wanted to share it for discussion. 

In my analysis, I determined which day of the week was most likely to have BTC price rise and which would most likely fall. Of the 2,518 data points (days), here are the numbers I have (#rise/#fall): 

Monday (181/185)

Tuesday (190/176)

Wednesday (198/167)

Thursday (170/195)

Friday (191/174)

Saturday (207/158)

Sunday (196/169)

Using this data, I determined the probabilities of rise/fall for each day of the week to find which days are most likely to rise/fall, here are those results in order of most likely to rise: 

Saturday (56.71%) - best day

Wednesday (54.25%)

Sunday (53.70%)

Friday (52.33%)

Tuesday (51.91%)

Monday (49.45%)

Thursday (46.58%) - worst day 

My personal results of this analysis: I started trading BTC 3 weeks ago. By day trading with $150, I've earned about $16 (with fees accounted for) and paid about $20 in trading fees. Whereas if I kept the SATS I bought originally, they'd have gained about $49 in value. Therefore, my ultimate takeaway is that day trading offers a way to keep the money in circulation, possibly the ability to keep money safer from the market drops, but in the end also shields you from potential long term gains as well.

I wanted to perform this analysis to compare potential of day trading to long term investments and out of curiosity. My takeaway is that weekends are generally great for price increases, and generally price will dip before and after the weekend. That said, statistics can be bullshit and there could be any number of other factors haha but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. Thoughts?

BTC,2025-02-02,post,BitcoinMarkets,CLSK is likely the most UNDERVALUED out of all BTC mining stocks,"Links: [Figures 1 to 4](https://x.com/charlesalza/status/1884811658276520184) and [Figures 5 to 8](https://x.com/charlesalza/status/1884817385045066183)

This is a long post that describes why and how CLSK will end up with a higher projected % BTC holdings per market cap in June 2025 REGARDLESS if $BTC gets to $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k (Figure 1). These figures indicate buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. Details below:

If one can’t explain in a sentence what a company does, then it’s unlikely to be a good company. The way BTC miners make money is by acquiring BTC at lower than market value and either selling immediately (like IREN) or holding until BTC price goes up (like LSK). Personally, I do not like it when BTC miners change plans last minute. Unlike RIOT who just announced HPC-AI interest, IREN has a track record of high operational uptime (which is necessary for HPC-AI) and has provided HPC-AI services since 2019.

In a nutshell, both CLSK and IREN have higher operational uptime (Figure 2) and higher efficiency (Figure 3) than competitors RIOT and MARA. Consistently meeting quarterly goals demonstrates efficient growth by IREN and CLSK and exemplifies why these two businesses expand (gaining market share) while competitors (like RIOT and MARA) scramble to mimic others to attract investors.

When it comes to companies holding BTC, CLSK may have more upside than others. Currently, most BTC miners have high percent shorts: CLSK (27.13%), MARA (24.12%), RIOT (19.91%), IREN (7.45%). As a rule of thumb, all shorts must eventually close positions which leads to more buy orders. BTC miners have been lagging BTC due in part to these high shorts and also by the end of year retail sell off brought on by the December federal reserve meeting. However, not every miner prioritizes shareholder value and it’s important to do your own research before buying into these higher risk stocks which are now trading at a much cheaper price.

CLSK has set itself up to be most shareholder friendly BtC holder this bull run. Factors that support CLSK include NO plans for additional ATM's, full funding for growth to 50 EH/s and industry low % revenue going to compensation (Figure 4). Unlike MARA (48.4%) and RIOT (79%), IREN and CLSK have only 29.24% and 24.38% of revenue going towards paying compensation (which is good for shareholders). On 1/10/2025, MARA announced a 300M dilution which will dilute current shareholders by 60%. Because MARA has 333M shares, this potentially means each MARA share can drop close to 50% within a day whenever this dilution gets processed. Furthermore, plans to grow by 7 EH/s and/or pursue HPC-AI means RIOT may likely seek another $750M ATM at the cost of shareholders.

Okay, okay… so what does this all mean? To figure that out, we have to take a look at some numbers...

CLSK will likely have the highest amount BTC holdings in June 2025 per dollar spent TODAY on CLSK shares REGARDLESS of BTC price at $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k. This is based on figures which add up current BTC holdings and projected mining revenue (Figures 5 to 8) with averaged out monthly growth based on current EH/s goals. The amount held in BTC is then divided by market cap (corrected for dilution and ATM) to give the projected percent BTC holding per market cap as shown by Figure 1.

This means that buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. The goal in buying BTC miners is to pick a company that acquires BTC cheaper which generates enough profit to outpace the gains one gets buying BTC. Unlike CLSK whose competitive advantage is finding sites at low cost, RIOT and MARA copied MSTR and took out loans via convertible notes to buy spot BTC. This artificially raised their BTC holdings and only leads to further release of ATM’s and/or dilution at the expense of shareholders tomorrow.

Out of good faith to those interested, I investigated this industry and formed my opinions based on the numbers I have observed. For CLSK, TTM price-to-sale (P/S) will likely drop by June 2025 to \~3.58 (which indicates \~2x value at current prices). CLSK had 39.1 EH/s with revenue of 668 BTC ($70.2M) in December 2024 which beat average revenue of 514 BTC from May 2024 to November 2024. With CLSK fully funding growth of 11.9 more EH/s (30.4%) by H1 2025, CLSK revenue will increase monthly by \~5% for a TTM annual revenue of 8,070 BTC ($807M).

The lower projected 3.58 P/S for CLSK is NOT priced in and does NOT account for holdings which would be \~13913 BTC ($1.39B) by June 2025 at $100k. If BTC reaches $150k by mid 2025, industry low cost of \~$64k per coin mined means CLSK makes \~$694M PROFIT from July 2024 to June 2025. This means CLSK would make $50k MORE PROFIT per coin mined than each coin RIOT and MARA bought at \~$100k. This is where the REAL value lies with mining stocks.

BTC,2025-01-20,post,BitcoinMarkets,Is Trump or his people smart enough to see what others have done before him?,"Imagine SBF but never having given CZ enough coins to rekt him. What would be the state today if CZ hadn't dumped on him?

I imagine FTX would still be running, Bitcoin would be at SBF's beck and call, loans would be impossible to margin call.

All Trump would have to do is hold the 80% and use some of the loan money to put in bids to prop up the price. Someone out there would be greedy enough to offer loans against it as collateral.

SBF simply took too much meth and couldn't keep track of things.

They gave CZ a bunch of coins to entice him to buy them out when still early, then forgot all about it. The books got messy because they never wanted to record any of the fraud, so they couldn't figure out how much reserve was needed to protect against him selling (or simply didn't realise it was a risk).

CZ got a look at the books and is much smarter, so he knew exactly how much FTT he needed to sell and how much Bitcoin he needed to buy in order to rekt them.

How?

Well... CZ was using BNB in the exact same way, so he knew the game. In the weeks before BNB pumped in order to get the ammo required. Then it all unwound.

Some time later, SBF realised he was rekt. Not long after that, he was in prison.

The first turd is where CZ was positioned.  
The 2nd turd is when SBF realised he was rekt.  
The 3rd turd is when SBF went to prison.

BTC,2024-11-24,post,BitcoinMarkets,A look back at the BoA Multiplier calculation,"Some time ago, I got interested in the Bank of America calculation of the multiplier. Many people assumed that knowing the multiplier would enable you to calculate a future price by simple multiplication of the net amount of dollars invested. [ I posted a calculation showing that using their multiplier was not so simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194358b/price_estimates_using_the_boa_multiplier/), and the price goes as the square root of the total dollars invested.

So as we approach $100K/btc, I was curious how things have played out over nearly a year.  I am going to assume that the total dollars locked into bitcoin for the multiplier is equal to the total ETF investment given [here](https://farside.co.uk/btc/) ($30.8B).  Also, I'm going to add in the total MSTR investment as given [here](https://mstr-tracker.com/) ($16.5B), and since I don't have the full MSTR ownership history, we're going to assume it all happened this year, which is an overestimate, but since my total investment is ETF+MSTR only, hopefully the overestimate captures some of the other investment that is being ignored.

With those (somewhat crappy) assumptions, and using the BoA multiplier value of 135, **the price predicted is $147K per bitcoin**.

OK, that's pretty far off. What could contribute to the error?

1. My overestimate of MSTR ownership happening all in the current year
2. The multiplier as calculated by BoA is too high
3. TheRe ARe EvIL mAnIpUlaTORs KEePING ThE PriCE DoWn!!1!

My best guess is reason 2, so I can turn around the calculation and use a current price of $97K and **solve for the multiplier instead. which turns out to be close to 50 at a price of $47K.**

I found it to be an interesting way of looking at price prediction in any case, and I have to wonder what price discovery is going to look like above $100K because I find it difficult to believe that BoA's multiplier is going continue to make any sense if the price accelerates higher.

Edit: To /u/[FreshMistletoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreshMistletoe/) point below, there's another way to look at it. Assuming that the multiplier is indeed 135, then another implication is that the total locked-up investment into bitcoin has increased by only $17B, implying that there has been about $30B of sales from lettuce-hands.

I was a bit fascinated by the concept of the BoA PR, with its bitcoin multiplier. People started applying it in a linear way, and I realized that the BoA definition implied it was not linear with the dollar input, but instead went as the square root.

So to the extent that you believe the multiplier has any predictive value, it implies that future price also goes as the square root of money invested.

But does it have predictive value? There are a lot of assumptions: BTC being locked down by ETFs, for example. Maybe there's money being unlocked elsewhere.  So I don't know for sure that there is value, which is partly why I wanted to take a look backwards before looking forwards.",2

Bitcoin did reach a new all-time high for a day or so at the time the ETFs were approved in the US, and since then bitcoin's price has stabilized at around $60,000.



Also, the charts I have seen that show how the amount of bitcoin in cryptocurrency exchanges keeps decreasing are misleading. The y axis on these graphs stop at the lowest amount of bitcoin available. If the y axis stopped at zero it would indicate more clearly how much the amount is decreasing and how long will it be until exchanges run out of bitcoin. So I asked ChatGPT to give me an estimate. Here it is below.



Remember that the price of bitcoin can skyrocket at any time for a variety of reasons. However, if ChatGPT's data is correct and if the only variable we are taking into account is how the bitcoin in the exchanges is decreasing, it seems like bitcoin's price will remain stable for the foreseeable future.

The event kicked off with Anthony Scaramucci sharing his cell phone number (917-439-3646) and speaking alongside David Ripley, the CEO of Kraken, an exchange where you can buy and sell digital assets. Ripley, a University of Illinois alum, has been involved in crypto since 2013. He emphasized two key messages:

**David Ripley** - CEO of *Kraken* UIUC alum been in crypto since 2013.

His two messages were

1)The U.S. is falling behind in crypto innovation and is no longer a leader in the space.

2) Innovation is crucial for both business growth and development.He believes the cycles are becoming more muted, (not as drastic highs and lows)

Ripley noted that crypto cycles are becoming more muted (less drastic in highs and lows). He highlighted that this year, over 50% of hedge funds have some exposure to the Bitcoin ETF, although their crypto allocations remain small. He anticipates more adoption within the next two years, especially from pension and sovereign funds. Kraken is focused on attracting more institutional and retail investors as they expand their global presence. He also sees the Middle East gradually entering the crypto space and expects another situation like FTX could occur.

**Salman Khan, CFO of Marathon Digital (a global Bitcoin miner)**

Khan discussed the backlog of large utility-scale projects expected to power data centers and noted increased interest from institutional investors. He predicted that energy harvesting businesses will replace traditional utility-scale Bitcoin mining within the next 4-8 years. Currently, they heat 11,000 homes in Finland through Bitcoin mining.

**Amy Oldenborg, Head of Emerging Markets at Morgan Stanley:**

Oldenborg advised reading the fine print regarding Morgan Stanley's recent announcement allowing registered clients to offer Bitcoin ETFs. This offering is only for taxable brokerage accounts, which represents a small part of their business but is still a significant first step.

**Joseph Chalom, Managing Director at BlackRock:**

Chalom is part of BlackRock’s small digital asset team and helped grow and scale the Aladdin platform. He emphasized that client demand drives everything they do. While not everyone is interested, BlackRock aims to offer crypto services in safe ways for those who are. He mentioned that clients are interested in tokenizing various assets, including buildings and income streams. Chalom also pointed out the need for a regulator-accepted digital identity solution and stressed BlackRock’s responsibility to educate the industry on crypto.

**Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton ($1.6 trillion asset manager):**

Johnson is the third-generation leader of Franklin Templeton, which her grandfather founded. They have tokenized a money market fund, participate in staking, and have a venture capital fund investing in the crypto space. She predicts that ETFs will eventually be tokenized.

BTC,2024-10-08,post,BitcoinMarkets,2x leverage swing trading scenario: good for fiat gains but diminishing returns for reinvesting in underlying asset?,"I am looking into using leverage for swing trading. I am still new to this and won't consider actually leverage trading before I better understand it, don't worry.

Here's a scenario. I hold 1 BTC and I will use 2x leverage (which is the maximum I am comfortable with for swing trading given its corresponding liquidation price). To simplify I won't include fees in my calculations. I close out the trade after each theoretical price increase and use the profits to buy BTC.

Scenario 1: BTC doubles in price, and I will have 1.5 BTC instead of 1 BTC (if I just held my BTC).  
Scenario 2: BTC triples in price, and I will have 1.66 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  
Scenario 3: BTC quadruples in price, and I will have 1.75 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  
Meanwhile, in fiat terms I will have made 1, 2 or 3 times (in scenarios 1 to 3, respectively) my inital btc investment (in USD) in profits. But I do not want fiat, I want Bitcoin. so for accumulating Bitcoin it is markedly less interesting than for making fiat gains. So it would make sense for me to only use this strategy if I invest the profits in something else than the underlying asset, like the stock market for instance.

I am all-in on crypto and it would be good for me to diversify by investing in the stock market. In this case I think 2x leverage swing trading would be attractive, trying to exit at 2-3x current market price. But it is a lot less attractive reinvesting the profits into the underlying asset, BTC, given the diminishing returns.  
Please let me know if my analysis has been sound thus or if I am missing something. I would not be comfortable increasing my liquidation price as the BTC price goes up.



Edit: the more I think about it, the more answers I think I am getting. Diminishing returns doesn't have to be a problem as long as Bitcoin outpaces, say the stock market, by roughly 2.5x (quick math). Given year on year historical growth records one would predict it will outpace the stock market by a far greater ratio so, actually, investing the leverage trade gains into Bitcoin will still be better than investing it into an asset like stocks.

Edit 2 months later, probably no one will read this but just in case: do your due diligence. There was a lot I didn't know about and still don't. I haven't used leverage and discovered more drawbacks such as rebalancing. Leverage is for short term and people who know what they are doing. Futures I can't trade where I live. ",2

If worse comes to worst, I am confident I could borrow the money necessary to lower my liquidation price to a safe territory from family.

...

> How are the asset’s Indicative Index Price and Expiration Value calculated?

> The Indicative Index Price of the underlying asset is calculated once every second throughout the entire contract duration of any Strike Options contract. CDNA calculates this indicative price value by taking the midpoints between the BID/ASK spread that occurred within the settlement calculation time period. There are minimum requirements for the number of midpoints that are included in the calculation, along with additional computations such as removing outliers from the dataset that ultimately determine the Indicative Index Price. The calculation used is a simple average of the included midpoints between the BID/ASK spread in the dataset, rounded to one decimal point past the precision of the underlying asset. The Expiration Value of the underlying asset will be calculated and produced by CDNA in the same manner on the Expiration Date.

Possibly an illiquid market. Not sure if you're selling to a counter-party or just a CFD back to the house, can't be bothered reading that far into it.

￼White House (Suzy Brooks/Unsplash) · CoinDesk

Krisztian Sandor, Cheyenne Ligon, Jesse Hamilton

Fri, March 7, 2025 at 11:54 AM EST 2 min read

Cardano's ADA, XRP and Solana's SOL slid on Friday after a White House official backpedaled on President Trump's recent announcement that he would sign an executive order instructing the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the creation of strategic crypto reserve comprised of ADA, XRP, SOL, bitcoin and ether.

""I think the president just gave five examples of cryptocurrencies in his post. Those five have to be the largest by market cap,"" the senior White House official said in a call with reporters ahead of Friday's White House Crypto Summit. ""I think people are reading into that a little bit too much. The bottom line is, I think that what we've announced here is consistent with what the president has always said about the space.""

According to data from CoinGecko, the official's assertion isn't strictly true. Taking out the two largest stablecoins – Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC – the five largest cryptocurrencies by market cap are bitcoin, ether, XRP, Binance's BNB, and SOL. Dogecoin is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with ADA right behind it.

In a March 2 social media post, Trump claimed that a ""U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks from Biden Administration."" The announcement that it would include SOL, ADA and XRP was met with criticism from many in the industry, who expressed concerns that the inclusion of altcoins in a strategic reserve could be a vehicle for corruption and self-dealing.

On March 6, Trump signed an order directing his administration to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, capitalized with the U.S. government's seized bitcoin holdings. The crypto stockpile containing other cryptocurrencies will be a separate entity.

ADA plunged over 5% to $0.82 in the minutes following his comments. XRP slid 3.5% to $2.41, while SOL was down 2%. All three tokens are firmly down over the past 24 hours alongside a weak crypto market. Meanwhile, BTC slumped to $87,000 giving up early morning gains.

Senior executives from across the crypto industry have convened in Washington, D.C. for the White House's first crypto summit on Friday afternoon. Crypto companies including Ripple, Gemini, Robinhood Crypto, Crypto.com, Chainlink and Anchorage will be in attendance.

BTC,2025-03-09,comment,btc,"Comment on: As suspected, the Trump tweets for ADA, XRP, SOL, ...",I wonder what the ratio is of Trump supporters to meme coin holders. Gotta be pretty dumb to base anything on what a con man told you.,3
BTC,2025-03-09,comment,btc,"Comment on: As suspected, the Trump tweets for ADA, XRP, SOL, ...","I'm having trouble understanding the BTC backlash from the summit. They said they're holding BTC, and finding ways to buy more. Eg, confiscated BTC, or converting confiscated alts to BTC. Those two alone could accrue non-trivially; plus they're investigating other approaches. So net, there's a likelihood of reserve BTC growing. But I keep seeing posts / comments saying there's no BTC growth future for this reserve. I'm definitely a dummy in cyrpto, so what am I missing?

Now.. I certainly believe in the Trump-and-dump. I planned on buying before the summit, and selling hours after. But nothing really happened, so I'm just hanging onto it for now. Mostly because I'm afraid of the FDIC hubbub, and I don't have the energy to fly to Switzerland to open a bank account convert to CHF. So: I think he's a scam artist - no doubt it - and we're all gonna die and the world is gonna end. But specifically regarding to BTC reserve and it growing, I'm not understanding the ""they won't buy"" stuff.",3

Not trusting themselves to understand it, they ignore it, believe what existing financial authorities tell them about it (often a rather biased story since 2009) and rather play the lottery (stonks, ponzi ""coins"" ... incl. BTC these days).

It's a shame. It really seems people need a shock (or a hugely visible, like nation level, example of how peer to peer cash adoption can succeed).

I don't think any form of speculation is the ""killer app"" for bringing Bitcoin awareness to the masses.

It's mildly encouraging that a lot of people now recognize the threat of inflation and the difficulty of saving for old age, and some of them may re-examine what is wrong with our financial systems and whether it's a problem inherent in the facile money printing of fiat (debt money).",41

Bitcoin will have to run its course as a shiny speculation widget long before someone looks over the horizon and discovers the real superpower. It's the point were USD are measured in terms of BTC/BCH, rather than BTC/BCH measured in USD.

I am a BCH fan, but I think a small linear inflation like XMR is better in the long run, as it replaces lost coins and more importantly prevents hoarding mentality as well.

A small linear inflation also doesn't set the max time limit on the adoption phase, as we clearly underestimated human stupidity.

True

Mostly not true, the reason it is not as hard is it lost the branding in the blocksize wars and btc took it. Additionally Tether supports BTC and likely trades against BCH (You could call blockstream and Tether a cartel)

I think realistically speaking this is pretty accurate. I've always been thinking somewhere around 180k. It just feels like everybody will be shouting for 200k but we won't make it (similar to 100k in 2021).

On the flip side, it'll be interesting to see what Q1 2025 brings. If the US actually follows through with BTC reserve and other governments follow suit, we could very well see a ""gold rush"" effect that could shoot us well past 200k. 

I'm more interested in the bear market that follows. Inevitably, hype will cause a bubble that will burst, but it might not play out the same as other cycles.

Redditors want crypto to fail and for you to be poor and miserable so they can say. GOTCHA Trump Elon BAD! If you have any success. For instance, how I've 10x'd my entire port since December. You will be downvoted, harassed, and possibly banned from a subreddit or the entire platform. 

Meanwhile, if you invested in the AI coin dip this week. You'd be up 300-400%. 

The dip is caused by the DeepSeek news and then the tariffs being announced on a weekend. 

But it has nearly fully recovered as I'm writing this on Monday. You have hundreds of comments claiming the end of crypto happened. It's so whacky. 

Reddit is a botted, biased, and censored commie echo chamber. If you're serious about crypto, GTFO! Take your profits along the way. Don't bid more that you can lose. Personally, I don't touch my majors until a year of hodling and look at them as a multi-year hodl. Otherwise, I try to jump on a narrative/meme under $100k-$500k.

I have literally never found good advice on Reddit regarding crypto post 2014. It's crazy because DOGE pretty much began on Reddit. It's a shit platform for it, even without the TDS psychos.",3

BTC,2025-07-11,post,btc,The $1 Billion Bitcoin Liquidation :Masterclass in Market Mechanics,"What happened in the past 24 hours was a systematic destruction of leveraged positions that demonstrates why betting against momentum in a bull market is financial suicide.

Bitcoin surged to $118,000, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations across 232,000 traders. This represents the largest single day liquidation event in four years. Bitcoin shorts alone lost $570 million, while Ethereum shorts contributed another $206.9 million.

 The liquidation cascade followed a predictable pattern ; institutional demand through spot Bitcoin ETFs created sustained buying pressure, while improving macro sentiment encouraged risk-on positioning across all markets..

When Bitcoin broke through key resistance levels, it triggered stop losses and margin calls in sequence;  High leverage traders who positioned themselves against the trend found themselves trapped in a feedback loop where forced buying from liquidations drove prices even higher.

The institutional flow data supports continued upward pressure. Spot ETF inflows have been consistently strong, creating organic demand that doesn't depend on leverage or speculation. This is patient capital that absorbs volatility rather than amplifying it…

Fighting momentum in a bull market, especially with leverage, is a strategy that consistently destroys capital. The market doesn't care about your opinion, only your position size and risk management.

This liquidation event should serve as a stark reminder that in crypto markets, position sizing and trend recognition matter more than being right about short term direction. The traders who survived and profited understood this fundamental truth.For those who profited from this volatility understand tools like awaken.tax help manage the complexity of reporting these rapid fire transactions across multiple positions and timeframes. The 232,000 who got liquidated learned it the expensive way.",14

The reason is that trading gaps are an organic result of how markets/exchanges work, if you can set a new much higher price with a single or few trades during times of little volume, the market will „gap“ higher and all participants resume trading their random walk near to where the gap closed.

All of crypto is pretty much illiquid, and the small cap cryptos proportionally more so. A fact well known to gap profiteurs. Gaps are used in this fashion, by buying enough of the market that you can install yourself as a stealth market maker (trading both sides of the spread) and then causing gaps at low volume times, and rake in the profits by offloading down from the gap spike or by sybil attacking the random walk.

The fact is that since 2017, Bitcoin is no longer only what people commonly think it is, which is the chain associated with the 'BTC' ticker.

The Bitcoin blockchain has split and carried on in two main directions:

- BTC
- BCH (Bitcoin Cash)

So to evaluate the question, one has to actually evaluate both of these at least (there are other forks of Bitcoin too, but those are the main ones).

He tossed a few carrots to the crypto people with his meme coin and asking institutions to ease on crypto regulations and that’s about as much as he cares

BTC,2025-02-12,comment,btc,Comment on: Trump ended the 2025 bullrun...,"If Trump manages to get his policies implemented, there will be a MUCH needed recession. We are living in an asset and real-estate bubble. Everything is artificially pumped: stocks, crypto, other assets.  Basically the bankers and finance world has been using the money-printer spigot to prop up markets.

We *need* a recession. And we need to end the massive money-printing that has been accelerating since the scam-demic. We need to end it because money-printing is a hidden tax on all USD holders and users -- it debases our money due to money over-supply.  While it's nice for bag holders to pump money-printed money into stocks or crypto.. it actually impoverishes the rest of the economy.  It's a cancer on the economy when governments do this.. when they produce massive inflation to artificially prop up some segments of the economy.

So .. yeah. Trump's policies will actually trigger a recession. But recessions are good things for economies long-term. They eliminate inefficiencies in the economy.  Firms are forced to get productive and efficient or die. It helps the economy long-term to ""reset"" in a way and remove inefficiency. It's akin to ""pruning"" in neural networks...

So it will be painful, if Trump manages to do what he has intended .. reduce federal spending (reduce money-printing), cut taxes, stimulate domestic supply chains via tariffs.

But it *will* trigger a recession. And yes, this may mean the asset-bubble that is the crypto world will suffer massively.

But long-term it will be good for BCH if this happens.",7

BTC,2024-12-24,comment,btc,"Comment on: Less noise, more facts on Bitcoin as a store of va...","**A commodity:**

* BTC is a commodity.
* OP has got my ""+"" for recognizing that.

**Deflationary nature:**

* As far as the *monetary inflation* of BTC is examined:
   * BTC is inflationary.
* As far as the *cost inflation* is examined:
   * Compared to other goods, general productivity increases do not decrease production costs of BTC (due to difficulty adjustments and block reward halving).
   * Therefore, in relation to other goods, the layer-1 BTC is deflationary.
* On the other hand, there are also ""paper BTCs"" (or IOU BTCs) that are not limited by the layer-1 rules. These tend to transform layer-2 BTC to an asset with both a monetary inflation and a cost inflation.

**Store of value:**

* As a book entry coin and a commodity, BTC is a store of value.
* BTC is not a widely usable store of value, though, since:
   * There is only a limited number of persons who can DCA BTC and hold their own keys.

**A currency:**

* BTC is not a currency.

I'd say: YES.

XMR is a pain in the ass to spend (have to wait for a number of confirmation, it's unlike Bitcoin Cash which you can respend immediately) and if you run a node for that sucker, you know it scales quite poorly. Can run a BCH node easily on RPi. Monero node? not so much. Client like to eat 20GB of RAM just to sync the chain. Not much in the way of DeFi capabilities that I can see, while BCH is approaching expressive power of Ethereum in terms of contracting abilities, and is has DEXes, vaults, algorithmic stablecoins, soon hopefully smart-contract based forms of privacy as well. Whole 'nother ballgame in terms of power. AND it's cheap (in tx fees) and FAST.

Not here to convince you, but BCH in 2024 is a very different beast than in 2017. It's LIT. Much more development going on than in Litecoin, if you ask me.",2

BTC,2024-12-13,post,btc,"Even if Bitcoin Cash does a 10x in price, the network could still easily reduce fees to compensate, through policy. But how would such a policy change roll out?","Technical background:

Current BCH network policy has the minimum relay fee at 1000 sat / kB, i.e. 1 sat/byte.

It is still possible to significantly slash the minimum fee without changing the actual protocol, to something like 100 sat / kB ( = 0.1 sat/byte) or in case BCH goes up x100, to 10 sat / kB.

Such new fee policies could be done even in this bull market if BCH does a x10 or more.

The question is whether BCH could roll them out easily enough, because they require coordination of full nodes, wallets, libraries etc.

---

Going lower than 1 sat/kB would require protocol changes (""Fractional satoshis"", i.e. subdividing a satoshi to have more decimal digits available, and thus be able to accurately pay fees smaller than 1 sat).

---

I think it is good to discuss this policy issue and the best ways to deal with it in advance, since I think a x10 in a bull market is not out of the question (at all).

BTC,2024-12-13,comment,btc,"Comment on: Even if Bitcoin Cash does a 10x in price, the netw...","Reminder: 

The Bitcoin: peer to peer electronic cash system (Bitcoin Cash) scaling plan involves gaining adoption to have many users, doing very large number of transactions on the network, each paying a low fee.

Where 'low' means it must remain competitive with the fees of other payment systems out there.

Right now we are sub-cent for a typical transaction. If we do 10x we will go to about a (US) cent or a little more. Still not bad, but staying sub-cent through policy would be better for adoption, and we need tons of that. 

EDIT: The fees/block are still negligible compared to the coinbase reward, we have a few more halvings before that changes. It is much better to gain adoption and concomitant value increase (which will slowly reflect in rising price) rather than have the fees go up a lot. Bitcoin Cash is competing with centralized payment systems that are (ostentiously) fee-free now, at least for some day-to-day cases, and alt coins with low/zero fees.

A few questions: 

How do you calculate the Node decentralization? ~~And it looks like you included non-mining nodes? why?~~ I see, you have mining decentralization too. 👍

>""Blocktime. 10 minutes, pretty stable"" 

That made me laugh 🤣. At least add the variance or the outliers. The average over the last two weeks isn't even 10min it's 9,49min

Why is a fee reward ratio of 1.6% Ok? When we need to reach 100% at some point?

Why BTC.D over 65%? When, again, the ideal is 100% and BTC has been making lower lows since the small blockers won.

It's your first video, so don't take this criticism to harsh 🙂 But you need to provide more info around all the subjects. Just reading out the numbers doesn't cut it 😉. Good luck!",2
BTC,2025-06-05,comment,btc,Comment on: My analysis of Bitcoin's current health...,"Thanks! Appreciate it! I get bored of people talking about price all the time, it tells us nothing about the Bitcoin network. Eh I'm still learning about how to calculate this and will be constantly tweaking my methods and adding new stats I feel are relevant. Basically my program uses HHI by counting nodes and then counts them within countries or certain areas to give an idea of how centralised the nodes are.

Lol yea I need to tweak the blocktime as 10 minutes isn't precise enough.

The fee-to-reward ratio was 'ok' as its been worse but I agree it needs to build A LOT for sustainability. Do you have any ideas on how this can be reached? Important topic I think.

BTC dominance will never reach 100% again as much as we may want it to as long as we live in a free market society, anyone can create their own dogshit shitcoins or BTC copycats. But 65% is the right direction we want, the last time it was above 65% was 4 years ago, so in the last 4 years its improving which is a good sign for the network IMO. I recommend looking at BTC dominance over the past 5 years.

Lol no I don't at all! I actually really want as much criticism as possible to improve and learn more! That's very valuable information thank you, I will take it on board for the next one, thanks!",2

Bitcoin split over this in 2017. BTC has to have high fees, because the blocksize is limited. BitcoinCash did not limit the blocksize it can pay the reward with many small fee tx.

>BTC dominance will never reach 100% again as much as we may want it to as long as we live in a free market society, anyone can create their own dogshit shitcoins or BTC copycats.

Likely the interesting bit is, that ""shitcoins"" existed before 2017 and Bitcoin still had nearly 100%. It was only after the blocksize war, than BTC lost  a ton of dominance. I don't know which value you would aim for, I don't think it has anything to do with health. It's just another way of measuring price.",1

BTC,2024-12-07,post,btc,The ignorance of the BTC/BCH halving cycle. This is what separates the exit liquidity from smart money.,"It’s mind blowing to me how many people claim to be crypto experts but fail to realize the effects of the bitcoin halving. If you are using BTC/BCH as an investment, you should be studying the halving dates , the cycle lows and highs. We are currently in the period of peak performance for atleast another 100-150 days. BCH will outperform BTC simply because it is lower market cap and on its second halving cycle. This cycle I expect the most dramatic upwards price action. The main component is all holders must not sell their tokens to ensure adequate supply shock. 


First Halving: April 8, 2020
	•	Price on Halving Date: Approximately $250. ￼
	•	Low: Around $220 in the days following the halving.
	•	High: Approximately $1,644 in May 2021, marking a substantial increase within 398 days post halving.

Second Halving: April 4, 2024
	• 	Price on Halving Date: Approximately $600
	
	•	Low: Around $280 in the weeks following the halving.
	•	High: ??? (LAST cycle saw approximately a 7x to peak) We are currently 247 days post halving. Tremendous upside within the next 100-150 days 💰🔄✅🫡.",0

BTC,2024-12-02,comment,btc,"Comment on: What happens when BTC fees are high, but ordinary ...","I'll give you an example from how real life would work in the case of large stores which already accepted Bitcoin as payment in the past.

Take one most know - Steam.

They used to accept Bitcoin, but stopped due to high fees and volatility.

In December 2017, they stopped accepted Bitcoin:

> high fees and incredible volatility. Valve says transaction fees, which are passed on to the company by Bitcoin payment processor Bitpay, surpassed $20 last week.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/steam-stops-accepting-bitcoin-payments-citing-extreme-volatility-fees

Incidentally this was the time when BTC was first pumped directly after the BCH fork.

Bitcoin Cash split off from BTC in August 2017, but at first many people, even in Bitcoin, were cautious about it and uncertain whether it would work reliably and could ""take off"".

So Steam (and some others) stopped using Bitcoin and crypto altogether.

&nbsp;

Now let's think what would happen if a world were possible where people can use a high fees, permanently congested coin as a store of value.

__Steam could have continued to use peer to peer electronic cash cryptocurrencies__, including (but I'm not saying necessarily) Bitcoin Cash for their daily business. There were a ton of options already, so they could've spread the risk over acceptance of various ""cash"" coins like Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Nano, Monero, and hedged that value immediately in a less volatile ""store of value"".

As a billion dollar business, they could probably have done that in the years from 2017-now and made even fatter stacks.

__But for a small business or individual, it is not easy to hedge in a coin with high fees__, because batching a large number of transactions to save on exchange and network fees is not economic for small time operators.

Imagine you don't live in a 1st world country and you get a weekly paycheck of a few hundred dollars, or even get some part of your earning in p2p cash. A lot of money in the local economy, but continuously hedging some of that against a high-fee ""digital gold"" coin at a cost of tens or even hundreds of dollars per transaction will be impossible. You will be forced to take your cash to a ""bank"" who will exchange it for you to an ""IOU"" for some harder assets.

You're way better off if p2p cash is accepted around you, and you don't need to exchange in order to spend and live.

I am very well aware of this. in fact I posted on the very same thread back in 2013 and 2015. 

> ...who know that this could be easily changed, but the decision not to do so, is political, not technical

I am far from convinced that there are not valid technical reasons for keeping the Bitcoin blocksize small. My experience with Monero scaling and fees have told me that big blocks do not solve the security deficit.. There is no evidence that increasing the blocksize in Monero will lead to an increase in the fee in reward. In fact the only reason that Monero's adaptive blocksize works is because Monero unlike Bitcoin in its various flavours has a fixed block reward of 0.6 XMR per block. In my view the security deficit in Bitcoin is a real **technical** problem and not a political problem. 

Rather than argue this I will let the historical data speak for itself. Here is the fee in reward for Bitcoin, Monero and Bitcoin Cash. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/fee_to_reward-btc-bch-xmr.html#log&alltime

What the evidence shows is that adaptive blocksizes and large blocks do not lead to the replacement of falling block rewards with transaction fee revenue. Quite the opposite, the best chance of replacing falling block rewards with transaction fee revenue is the Bitcoin approach. this being said there is no guarantee that even the drastic approach taken by Bitcoin will work. 

Again I will just let the data speak for itself.",1

An electronic cash system is an instance of a communication network - the data being communicated is financial.

Metcalfe's Law:

(paraphrasing)

> The value of a (communications) network grows with the square of the number of its participants.

---

Someone put it differently:

> It states that a network's impact is proportional to the square of the number of nodes in the network

""Nodes"" here being a term from graph theory, in this case referring to network users -- not related to the concept of network nodes in Bitcoin.

---

Anything that reduces the number of users of the network dramatically, such as pricing people out of using a financial system, is going to have an impact on the value of that system.

You _want_ as many people as possible to be able to use it, and to use it actively and independently of the other users.

Centralization of a system reduces the number of users that can meaningfully participate.

Artificially limiting network capacity is a great way to eliminate network growth and centralize the system around gatekeepers that enforce and can afford high fees and/or provide re-intermediation to users priced out.

---

What I don't understand is some people claiming we'll soon be able to use L3's on Bitcoin when there isn't even a viable L2 scaling solution. I'm not sure if they are making a joke. Because if there were a viable L2 scaling solution, we wouldn't need L3's, right? Similarly, if there were a viable scaling solution for L1, then ... _oh_.

---

TL;DR

BTC lost > 90% of its _original_ network capacity through the political decision to turn what was intended to be a spam protection limit (1MB) - set above the network demand of the time - into something like a permanent feature (which creates the ceiling for the blue line in the graph).

Since BTC limits the transactions between users the connection in the system is very lose to none existent. You can sell your BTC today and go on with your life without any repercussions.

There may be a crossover period where this happens, I'm not excluding that.

I predict it's not a lasting, stable state since with increasing BCH adoption will come hashpower and price rise which takes away mindshare and market share from BTC.

The BTC chain has been deliberately stripped of its utility as an L1 MoE, and the piper _is_ going to be paid for that. This is not ""sowing division"", it is stating something that is pretty clear to those who've been following Bitcoin from the early days. The system has been modified, and it hasn't been modified to compete as money, despite what BTC propagandists try to tell everyone.

BTC,2024-11-26,post,btc,"Game-plan for how large financial institutions will manipulate the price of BTC up to $1,000,000! ","Step by step guide for large financial institutions like Blackrock to manipulate Bitcoin: 

1. Pay developers a lot of money to maintain the Bitcoin protocol in a way that discourages everyday peer to peer cash trading (as was intended) and instead encourage holding onto it for extended periods of time. This can be done by keeping transaction fees relatively high. 
2. Pay people to be gate keepers of the narrative on social media and squash dissenting opinions. Overall you want to keep Bitcoin holders happy with the price going up. Making belief it is the only true signal of Bitcoin being successful. It’s important to measure Bitcoin’s success by market cap rather than utility as peer to peer cash (as white paper eludes to). After all, who doesn’t love to make money? 
3. Have large financial institutions own a majority stake in Miners, to have an influence in the protocol. This will ultimately euthanize Bitcoin so that it can’t ever come close to competing against the banks as being the middleman in financial transactions. 
4. Have ETFs to encourage people to not actually hold keys to their own Bitcoin, but instead have exposure through ETF. This ensures that Bitcoin will not give you the financial freedom that was intended. Additionally it is easier to obfuscate BTC holdings in the ETF. 
5. Most importantly, create wild booms and busts of the price to shake out weak hands and get an even greater share of the market cap. Artificially create bull runs by using billions to buy Bitcoin so that it can run from $7,000 to $62,000. Watch the plebes, that are in it to make a lot of money, buy in at $60,000 because they don’t want to miss out. Then sell billions in a matter of days and buy it in an alternate account to create a bear market. This way the BTC holdings can be kept while bringing the price down to $16,000. On the way down buy up the holdings of plebes with weak hands who bought it at $60k and now are selling at a $42,000 discount. Then just keep doing that over and over to discourage and price people out until you hold a significant market share. We are seeing this play out right now 😬. 

This is why I still hold BTC, because it is manipulated by large institutions and it is going to go keep moonshoting in price. We haven’t even seen nothing yet. There is a lot of money to be made here. I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw $1 million BTC soon. However, this is also why I diversify with Bitcoin Cash, who actually holds true to the original intent of Bitcoin. 

What are the next steps for these institutions? 🤔 Since they own a majority share of the miners, they can then use that to get the developers to fork over to a new protocol that is eco friendly. Because it is more healthy for the environment to do proof of stake than proof of work. At that point it is check mate because doing POS will benefit the majority stakeholders of BTC; which are these large institutions.

BTC,2025-03-10,post,btc,Possibility of price-pumping attack against Bitcoin Cash,"Something I'm wondering about:

What if TPTB, after successfully price-pumping BTC over the last few years, and stifling its adoption as p2p cash, now turn around and let BTC practically deflate (27% down from ATH already in just 2 months) while

- they can claim BTC failed (in its only remaining ""hope"", as a SOV)
- they can cheaply pump BCH price merely through converting the large amounts of BTC they've accumulated, accomplishing both goals of depressing BTC price to claim a general Bitcoin failure, and at the same time causing the same adoption hindrance on BCH that high price does on BTC (fewer people can afford it, leading to fewer people to try it, increasing tx fees, slowing commercial adoption which is the primary risk they face with BCH)

Just spitballing here.

It's not obvious how such a price pump to put BCH out of reach for many could be used as a vehicle for increased campaigning against Bitcoin Cash, but the old arguments of ecological wastefulness would transfer from BTC to BCH if it had both a high price and low transaction volume. And having a high price might transfer a lot of the speculative momentum, and thus enable the arguments of greater-fools-scheme and lack of utility that currently apply to BTC as the crippled Bitcoin chain.",14

BTC,2025-01-06,comment,btc,Comment on: Basic modelling on Bitcoin price as a function of ...,"I don't think these numbers mean anything. However, with BTCs crippled blocks, at most those 37m owners get to make one transaction every 57 days. If there was 84m owners, they only get to make **one transaction every 130 days**.

But blocks are already full, without all those owners making a transaction. Some portion of BTCs TPS is from inelastic demand, i.e. those transactions are being made regardless of fees (to a point). Which means those 7 TPS arent all available. At a guess, I would say, at most 20% is elastic, about 1.4TPS, so in reality 37m owners get to make one transaction every 9 months, and 84m owners **one transaction every 2 years**.

If everyone did what you did (buy&withdraw every month), according to your own owner estimate, **BTC would need at least 24mb blocks**. And we havent even gotten in the transaction churn caused by trying to use LN…

The ""Transactions"" timeframe cannot possibly be ""year"" with those numbers for the column.

---

Some more notes based on my own research.

I think the number of real owners is probably an over-estimate.

A lot of owners hold many more than a single UTXO, and the number of addresses in BTC right now is about 54.5M (bitinfocharts rich list data), so the total number of self-custodial holders in the entire world can be at most 54.5M .

It's going to be _much_ lower than - I wouldn't be surprised if the average number of addresses per user is significantly above 2.

That's already < 27M real owners, i.e. below the model estimates.

If the average is in the range 5-10, that means real owner figures probably in the 5-10M range -- way below the model estimates.

It would be interesting how the model's owner figures are really derived, whether there's any possible substance to such high numbers.

3. Created a scatter plot for the end of year BTC price against the number of assumed owners, to determine the equation of the line. This formula is in my latest post (this sub doesn’t allow posting multiple pics at once, so there are three posts).

4. Using the formula (for the line), I plugged in the projected number of BTC owners (purple text), which gave an output of the projected price based on the existing formula.

According to Broyles, the energy required to mine the final singular Bitcoin will surpass the combined energy it took to mine the first 20,000,000 BTC. He predicts that producing the final Bitcoin could consume energy over the entire first third of the 22nd century.


1.15 million Bitcoin left to mine
Bitcoin’s supply is pegged at 21 million coins. Of the 21 million total Bitcoins, 19.85 million have already been mined, leaving approximately 1.15 million remaining.


Because of Bitcoin’s halving occurrence, it will most certainly take years to mine the remaining coins. The last Bitcoin to be produced and released into circulation is predicted by the end of the year 2140, ensuring that the Bitcoin mining process slows down in the market over time.


After mining is completed, no new Bitcoins will be released into the market. The miners will then use transaction fees to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain.

BTC,2025-03-23,post,btc,"Schedule Bitcoin transactions by lock time, fees or price (my open-source project)","Hi Everyone, 

I thought for a while about applications that could be useful for bitcoiners. I realised that there is no service on the market that allows you to schedule bitcoin transactions. 

The problems such a service could solve: 

* dead man's switch: allows someone to create a timelocked transaction that sends funds to a backup wallet if a user loses access to their keys or passes away, this would use nLockTime to ensure that the transaction is only broadcast after a certain amount of time
* Auto reset your blockstream green 2fa multisig by scheduling a self transfer transaction to a fresh address
* Transfer bitcoin when fees are low: create a transaction with a low fee and only broadcast it when fees come down, preventing it from getting stuck in the mempool
* Transfer bitcoin at a certain USD price: send your bitcoin to the exchange, or to buy a particular item only when it is at a certain price

My project allows you to do all this. It is an open-source API that allows you to post your signed raw transactions and only broadcast them when certain conditions are met. Transactions can also be removed from the service at anytime. 

Code: https://github.com/bitcoinwarrior1/bitcoin-transaction-scheduler

API docs: https://github.com/bitcoinwarrior1/bitcoin-transaction-scheduler?tab=readme-ov-file#api

Endpoint: https://bitcoin-transaction-scheduler-e26333afefee.herokuapp.com

What do you guys think about this project? Any suggestions for additional features? Please let me know. 

Please note that this is just a hobby project and should only be used for trivial amounts. Use it at your own risk.

Interested in other bitcoin projects? Check out https://bitcoinprojects.net/.",2
BTC,2025-03-23,comment,btc,"Comment on: Schedule Bitcoin transactions by lock time, fees o...","I looked at the source code and this is an app that you have to run somewhere. Not only that, it relies heavily on other third-party APIs, so there's a lot of trust involved, specially in the dead man's switch use case you mentioned. If any of the APIs (or this app itself) stops running or changes for whatever reason, it's game over.

If you can get rid of the third-party APIs and perhaps rely on a local node to broadcast the transaction, for example, than I think it would be an improvement.

At its current stage, I would not rely on it.

PS: you should work on a BCH version with the improvements mentioned above :)",2

It makes me wonder: if big money is coming back to crypto, what’s the next move for Bitcoin and mining companies?
Obviously, Bitcoin benefits directly — more capital flowing into exchanges means more buying pressure. But miners are the ones supplying new BTC. Companies like $MARA, $RIOT, and $CANG (which mined almost 1,000 BTC last quarter and is holding close to 2,000 BTC now) could be poised to gain a lot if Bitcoin starts flying again and supply gets tighter.
Does anyone think mining stocks will start moving soon? Or is the market still waiting for a Bitcoin breakout before jumping into miners?",0

Do you trust your government to hold your money for you? That is called having a national (central) bank, and by implication a central bank digital currency.

It's the straight road to having your government telling you what you can & can't do, instead of the people deciding for themselves.

Most young adults realize that independence and autonomy starts with owning your finances.

Heck, a war of independence was fought to establish the country, which was at least in part related to financial impositions by an external authority.

None of what Bitcoin promised can be provided to a large number of people, not even a small country or a city, if the system is not allowed to scale and be used as money directly.^1 

But the legacy financial system seems hell bent on preventing exactly that - flowery talk by politicians notwithstanding, and I include Pompliano in that category. That man can't run a Bitcoin-based pizza shop.

Is this not just a super fucked up dystopia? They got that rich from doing what exactly? Adding no value to society. You really think people who bought $1000 worth of anything in 2010 should be a billionaire today?

Continuing the assumption Bitcoin is literally the earlier you jump on ship the better, rich people have more spare money so they can afford to invest early and normal people live paycheck to paycheck can't even invest that much even if they want to, so it's literally more beneficially for rich people if the price goes up.

Bitcoin's price action is flashing bearish signals, making it an exciting moment for traders looking to capitalize on short positions. Let’s break down the latest technicals and discuss a sell trade setup that could offer profitable opportunities in this volatile market.

🔥 Why Bitcoin Looks Bearish Right Now

📉 1-Hour Chart Analysis: BTC is showing clear signs of weakness, struggling to maintain bullish momentum.

📊 EMA Strategy (15-Min Chart):

The 9 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is crossing below the 15 EMA, a classic bearish signal that traders watch for short entries.

This suggests that selling pressure is increasing, and a further downward move is likely.

📌 Potential Sell Position Strategy

✅ Entry Point: $81,454 – This is a key level where fresh short positions can be considered.

  🛑 Stop-Loss: $82,000 – A crucial level to protect against unexpected upside moves.

🎯 Target: $79,100 – A reasonable profit target based on support levels.

📊 Key Resistance Levels:

$82,000 – If BTC breaks above this, short positions may need to be reconsidered.

$83,500 - $84,000 – Strong resistance zone.

📉 Key Support Levels:

$80,000 – A psychological level to watch.

$79,100 - $78,500 – Potential next downside targets.


⚠️ Risk Management Tips!

🔹 Use Stop-Loss Orders – Protect your capital from sudden market swings.

🔹 Leverage with Caution – If using leverage, manage your risk wisely to avoid liquidation.

  🔹 Monitor Market Sentiment – Bitcoin’s price action often reacts to news and macroeconomic factors.

🔍 Final Thoughts: Will the Downtrend Continue?

Bitcoin is showing strong bearish tendencies, and if the 9 & 15 EMA crossover continues to play out, we could see BTC drop toward the $79,100 level. However, crypto markets can be unpredictable, so always trade with a solid risk management plan.

We've had irrevocable trusts on BCH since 2022, that miners could be paid to prepare and execute, but miners don't care. 

You can offer miners a super predictable stream of free money, as a faucet, but [random people will end up taking it.](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/3HbmNXQPd7WRtgekdLb2SifZvTMpQbJGLC)

Anyhedge uses MEV to auto-complete swaps, Badgers uses MEV to auto-complete locks. Three protocols in three years is too much to keep up with?

While yes, there are indeed basically infinite possibilities for how MEV can be used in BCH, but ironically, the people maintaining the network seem less interested in claiming the money than random app users.

Miners aren't going to start rejecting valid transactions because there could have been MEV they could have gamed.",2

2. **20% Drop for ""a Couple of Weeks""**: You’re saying BTC will shed $20K (or more) and stabilize there just long enough for retail investors to panic and sell... only to watch it recover and double shortly after. Classic market manipulation vibes. Are we blaming whales for this, or is this part of your ""market mechanics"" thesis?
3. **Doubling After the Dip**: BTC going from $80K to $160K within what I assume is a tight timeline feels... bold. Perhaps you're factoring in global hyperinflation, unprecedented institutional FOMO, or Satoshi rising from the ashes?

In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump said he had granted Ulbricht a ""full and unconditional pardon,"" citing support from the Libertarian movement and criticizing the government’s handling of Ulbricht’s case.

Ulbricht, 40, was convicted in 2015 on charges including conspiracy to traffic narcotics and money laundering in connection with the Silk Road, a darknet site that facilitated billions of dollars in illegal drug transactions.

He received a sentence of two life terms plus 40 years without parole, sparking years of debate over the fairness of his punishment. In his post, Trump labeled Ross' sentence as ""ridiculous.""

BTC,2024-09-08,post,btc,how do I get fair value for real Bitcoin? (i.e. on-chain BTC not Coinbase BTC),"As a follow-up to my question about Coinbase:

If Timmy owns a self-custody bitcoin and Janey owns a Coinbase bitcoin then Timmy could make a case that his Bitcoin is worth more than hers, because Timmy's bitcoin is backed by mathematics whereas hers is backed by the promises of bankers in a sector that is rife with fraud.

I read that Coinbase claims to be ""full-reserve"", but very few people believe it. Customers regularly complain that they are unable to access their funds. The sector as a whole has an even worse record: companies like FTX keep going up in smoke for fraud.

I keep asking if Coinbase and their sellers can print Bitcoin at will. So far nobody has been able to say, ""No, they can't"". 

I don't use Coinbase. Why should I care? Well if they can print Bitcoin at will, it massively devalues my hard-earned Bitcoin. Even though my Bitcoin is on-chain and in self-custody, that doesn't matter if the gullible public are willing to buy a fake Bitcoin for the same value as my real Bitcoin.

The official value of BTC is published by exchanges. This appears to be a mix of the value of real BTC and the value of paper BTC. 10% vs 90% ? Nobody seems to know. Maybe real BTC is already worth ten times more than the published value.

But how can I sell on-chain BTC for its real value? I can see that the value of real BTC could continue to go up if it could be separated from paper BTC. Otherwise there is no reason at all for it to go up. The price will remain stagnant.

When Trump was first President he didn't have any actual goals other than ""be President"". He is a narcissist and all he cared about was being seen as ""the guy"", and his talking points were just that. He mostly just delegated the real job to the folks around him, and most of those folks were traditional politicians and wonks.

This time it is different. He has some real goals, and he'll be more serious about ""draining the swamp"". He's also collected some better people, who he will be delegating to, who are not just cynical ""politics as usual"" folks. Many of them are favorable to crypto.

BTC,2024-11-17,comment,btc,Comment on: Is Bitcoin Set to Skyrocket? Prediction Markets Re...,"Ah, **prediction markets**—those noble oracles of our time, harnessing the collective wisdom of internet strangers armed with spare change and a dream. The article opens with a nod to their recent ""success"" during the U.S. presidential election, as if *one* instance of moderate accuracy absolves prediction markets of their long history of glorified coin-flipping. But now, apparently, they’re the go-to seers for Bitcoin's next meteoric rise. Nothing says *scientific rigor* like throwing money into Polymarket and Kalshi while crossing your fingers.

**Bitcoin at $91,000**, they say, is on the cusp of greatness. A mere *72% chance* of reaching $95,000 by November—music to the ears of the overly optimistic! Yet, with all the market complexity boiled down into neat percentages, one has to wonder: Did Polymarket consult the fabled Magic 8-Ball for their methodology? After all, “Ask again later” feels like it would add just as much value to these *profound* odds.

Moving on to Wall Street’s contribution: Enter **Tom Lee**, a man whose bullish proclamations are less market analysis and more motivational pep talks for hodlers. His March forecast of $150,000 Bitcoin by year-end was bold—*too* bold, perhaps, given the calendar and reality. But not to worry! When the facts don’t align, simply pivot: Now it’s *“six figures”* by December and astronomical gains in 2025. Lee’s reasoning hinges on the halving cycle and “lighter regulation,” because clearly, no government has *ever* meddled in crypto to fill its coffers during bull runs.

And what would a crypto-enthusiast pep rally be without Quinn Thompson, the founder of the aptly named **Lekker Capital**? His optimism is, dare I say, *lekker indeed*: $100,000 Bitcoin by year-end, with the perfect hedge of “we’ll see.” Groundbreaking analysis, Quinn. Truly, you’ve given us reason to believe that the future of Bitcoin hinges on *vibes and hope*.

Then, there’s the pièce de résistance: the undeniable math. Bitcoin has surged a staggering **32% this November** alone, more than doubling this year. Surely, it can squeeze out another 10% to hit $100,000! Never mind those pesky stock market dips or rising Treasury yields; the fact that Tesla is thrown into this cocktail of unrelated variables just adds to the article’s flavor of blind enthusiasm. If Tesla stock correlates with Bitcoin, then my morning coffee must correlate with the S&P 500.

Ultimately, this article leaves us with one thing we can all agree on: Bitcoin’s price is a source of endless fascination, and its journey captivates investors everywhere. Whether it’s Polymarket, Wall Street, or hedge fund managers, their predictions combine the accuracy of horoscopes with the fervor of a late-night infomercial. So grab your popcorn (or your Bitcoin wallet, if you dare)—because the only certainty in all of this is the entertainment value of watching the madness unfold.",3

BTC,2024-07-31,post,btc,Can indicators predict the future of crypto or BTC with high accuracy?,"I'll get ahead of the commentators but absolutely NO, indicators cannot predict the future with great accuracy. Sense of then its help traders observe trends to gauge their direction and strength. Think of it like Newton’s physics: a price movement has momentum, and the bigger it is, the harder it is to stop (inertia). This concept is reflected in the saying: “The trend is your friend.”

To illustrate this, imagine there are 21 days left until Christmas, and a popular toy is flying off the shelves. If you’re a store owner considering stocking up on these toys, you might observe the sales trends of neighboring stores. If sales rise from 20,000 to 30,000 units a day, you might decide to stock up. However, if sales suddenly drop, you'd be cautious. Even with a good prediction, replicating the exact sales figures isn’t feasible.

Indicators work similarly by using formulas and charts to help traders visualize potential future movements of prices and market behavior. Here’s a look at some commonly used indicators:

# 1. Ishimoku Clouds

The **Ishimoku Clouds** indicator consists of five lines representing averages over different periods. When two lines cross, the area between them forms a ""cloud."" If the price is above the cloud, it indicates an uptrend; below the cloud suggests a downtrend. The direction and movement of the cloud help assess the strength of the trend.

# 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The **RSI** is a simple yet powerful tool that shows whether an asset is overbought or oversold. It uses historical data to gauge demand. The RSI has two key levels: 30% (oversold) and 70% (overbought). Values above 70% might indicate a potential price drop, while values below 30% suggest a possible price rise.

# 3. Moving Averages

**MA** smooth out price data over a specific period to help identify trends. They are useful for spotting support and resistance levels. Short-term MAs react quickly to price changes, while long-term MAs provide a broader view. Support levels indicate where prices might stop falling, while resistance levels show where prices might struggle to rise.

# 4. Fibonacci Levels

**Fibonacci Levels** are another tool for predicting price dynamics. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence and provide standard levels (0, 23.6%, 38.1%, 50.0%, 61.8%, 76.4%, 100%) to track price movements. Although not complex, these levels can be useful for understanding potential price retracements and extensions.

# 5. Sales Volume

**Sales Volume** measures the number of assets traded over a period. It’s a crucial indicator as it helps validate price movements. High volume indicates strong market participation and momentum, while low volume suggests weaker momentum. For instance, if the price of Bitcoin spikes but the volume is low, it might signal that the price movement could reverse.

EDIT: If you think I'm wrong, feel free to criticize me!!! Because I don't think so, but you can still make me understand.

EDIT 2 : And what i mean in automated Ta is something that really use algotrading for analyze of indIcators, not some sh\*tty trading bots.In more detail, we can generally analyze briefly MACD on this dashboard, at the moment the trend in BTC is clearly bullish, respectively, in a bull market you should sell what you have already bought before in a bearish trend. 

This dashboard uses algorithms to calculate indicators and their score on their own buy/sell scale, where high scale mean buy. I hope you find it useful if you are learning or want to simplify your technical analysis as much as it helped me

I think if you really want to try using TA to trade bitcoin, only trade during US market hours on day trades.  The liquidity and after-hours price action always shows huge bearish divergences with the indicators and the price magically floats up on BS volume. My advice would be to stick to the stock market.  This type of TA works a lot better, and is much easier to make money at, in that environment.",3

1H Chart: Bitcoin has formed some short-term Bearish RSI Divergence and a Falling Wedge Pattern. 📉⬇️ After forming the Bearish Divergence, the price fell to right above the $66,498 support and bounced back up. 📈💥

There are two options here:

 1. The #BTC/USDT price could continue up from its current price, break the upper trendline of the wedge, and continue up to yesterday’s high of $68,498. 🚀💪
 2. It could fall back to that $66,498 support before bouncing back up. However, if it can’t hold the $66,498 support, it could continue to the $65,000 support next. 🚨⬇️

I will continue to update Bitcoin’s progress throughout the rest of today. So hold on to your Bitcoin because its next move could be explosive! 🧨💥",0

BTC,2025-06-28,post,CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin price suppression isn’t a theory but it’s strategy.,"Billions in inflows, yet BTC barely moves. Why?

Because this isn’t a free-flowing market anymore. It’s a structured ignition zone. Here’s what’s likely happening behind the curtain:

1. **ETF inflows are real.** Institutions and sovereign players are absorbing supply through cold storage. That BTC isn’t coming back to exchanges.

2. **Exchange liquidity is mostly paper.** What you’re seeing on the order books is often IOUs—fractional reserves of “paper bitcoin” without full backing. Real coin is scarce.

3. **Whales are rotating silently.** Early miners, large OTC wallets—they’re feeding liquidity in a way that avoids slippage or visible demand shocks. It’s stealth accumulation.

4. **Volatility suppression is intentional.** Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity need a stable BTC price environment for regulatory approvals, integration into tradfi systems, and settlement infrastructure buildout.

5. **The real breakout is postponed.** This isn’t about chasing hype. Once it escapes velocity and runs, it becomes unreachable to most. The door closes.

In short: **This market is being positioned, not traded.**

The illusion of stagnation hides an enormous structural transition.

It’s not about “why isn’t BTC pumping?”
It’s “why are so many working to stop it from doing so?”",276
BTC,2025-06-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Bitcoin price suppression isn’t a theory but it’s ...,"Yes, ETF inflows are real. Institutions are slowly stacking BTC, usually via algorithmic trading to avoid moving price.

Yes, real BTC is scarce. Most exchange volume is derivatives, not spot. “Paper BTC” dominates visible liquidity, but this isn’t new or suspicious. It’s just how modern markets function.

Yes, whales accumulate quietly. OTC desks and algorithmic execution make big buys invisible. It’s not a secret operation, it’s standard practice.

No, volatility suppression isn’t a coordinated conspiracy. It’s a byproduct of low retail speculation, high institutional presence, macro uncertainty, and thinner post halving liquidity  Not a master plan from BlackRock.

No, the breakout isn’t “postponed.” The market is in consolidation. Big moves follow periods of boredom. That’s how accumulation phases always look.

This market isn’t being manipulated to stay flat, it’s evolving. You’re watching a transfer of BTC from weak hands to strong ones, behind a curtain of low volatility and market structure that hides real demand.

You sound smart, but it’s financial clickbait. Preying on FOMO and conspiratorial instinct. Are you positioning yourself like an impatient gambler or a long term holder who understands market cycles, ETF mechanics, and macro liquidity?",120
BTC,2025-06-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Bitcoin price suppression isn’t a theory but it’s ...,"It’s an interesting theory.  It should be possible to prove this by doing some analytics on the blockchain.  That would make this more convincing.

When they started in January 2024, Grayscale was the only existing closed spot fund holding 600,000 BTC for their clients. When converting to an ETF, they chose a very high fee leading to a sell-off into the inflows.

This way, ETFs could accumulate while only pushing the price about +100 % in the first year. With Grayscale now rotating to different products and markets maturing, this countermeasure is now gone and following years could show much higher yields.",5

BTC is losing ground fast in other currencies.","Somebody asked this question in bitcoin subreddit. He even measures the BTC value in $$$ in his post. Yes its ""Steady"" in dollar value, but dollar is losing against every other currency worldwide now almost. So you are infact losing money daily.

And for all the USA people thinking ""this doesnt affect me"". It does. Your currency is becoming weaker thus you can buy less from traded goods. USA made (lmao) items wont be affected, you know the REAL homemade. Not the items that are USA made but still contain 380 imported components.

Dollar losing strenght should have bitcoin go up to compensate, but it doesnt.

This is everything bitcoin community hoped for. Bitcoin becoming the new world currency. What they forgot while screaming ""BTC TO ONE MILLION"" is the fact that when that happens a car probably costs 500k in dollar value.

Edit 7 days later: And dollar lost another 4% compared to Euro this week. Im sure thats nothing to worry about right... right? Bond market is cooked and this wont end well. Foreign investors are massivly pulling out USA ",110

For inflation to outpace BTC growth, something drastic would have to change. More drastic than the wars and pandemics we've already been through. In the short term, you could be right... Temporarily. Nobody can predict what happens in the short term.


But from what we've seen so far, 20,000 BTC used to buy you two pizzas. Now that amount would change your life and many future generations to come.

Compare that to fiat, which in the not too distant past, $20k bought you a house. Now it buys you a second hand Mitsubishi. 

Over the last 15 years or so, the price of a home has doubled in cash terms. And in the last handful of years has halved in terms of BTC.

Could also just keep blasting further and faster than expected, as it has since the election. there might be a pullback, there might not. most traders would have expected consolidation around 81.5k, but we just blasted through.  


My plan for altcoins was to buy the market low which i had placed around 16k for BTC at the time(close enough…i always start re-accumulating when btc is down 75%-80% fom previous ATH) , accumulate promising coins, then switch into the ones that were outperforming btc in the lead up to the halving and ditch the ones that weren’t. I will hold until BTC looks toppy (monthly rsi around 90’s, coinbase #1 on app store, pi cycle top fires, or we approach 2026 without having crashed yet)


  i like coins with a credible professional team that put out results, viable tech with a realistic demand, and a psych factor that would suggest normies will pile in when they hit the market. Balls deep in the AI sector (I like FET, AITECH, LKI, CGPT for this cycle) a bag of INJ and some TOKEN for RWA factor 


 Look into the four year halving cycle, pi cycle top indicator, rainbow chart and self custody.

Whales collaborate and see a potential profit if they dump after mainstream people buy in.  Whales decide to dump after holidays. Bitcoin crashes to 50k.

BTC,2025-03-26,post,CryptoMarkets,Michael Saylor claims that Bitcoin's M.Cap will hit $200 trillion by 2045. Could someone explain to me the basis of this prediction?,"From this [article](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/25/michael-saylor-200-trillion-bitcoin-strategy-us-btc-domination-immortality):

>Strategy Chair Michael Saylor envisions Bitcoin as a $200 trillion asset class by 2045, transforming it into a global settlement layer for the AI-driven internet age. He believes U.S. adoption of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve will cement its dominance, forcing worldwide adoption.

He's so confident that he gives serious investment advice to the US government, like:

>At President Trump’s White House Digital Assets Summit on March 7, Saylor proposed that the U.S. acquire 5%-25% of the total bitcoin supply by 2035 that could generate an estimated $100 trillion in economic value by 2045.

The article didn't mention the logic behind this prediction. That is what I try to understand. This interesting [website](https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/) shows the top world assets by market cap. Here are the top ten in the list:

1. Gold   $20.300 T
2. Apple   $3.330 T
3. Microsoft   $2.900 T
4. NVIDIA   $2.753 T
5. Amazon   $2.131 T
6. Alphabet (Google)   $2.035 T
7. Silver   $1.925 T
8. Saudi Aramco    $1.719 T
9. Bitcoin   $1.717 T
10. Meta Platforms (Facebook)   $1.548 T

So if Bitcoin's market cap becomes $200T by 2045, what about the market cap of other assets? Will they grow at the same rate? If so, does the size of the required economy make sense?",45

BTC,2025-03-13,post,CryptoMarkets,Why didn't ETH follow BTC in the November bull run?,"So I tapped out on crypto like 2 years ago, i basically broke even, at some points I was up 3X, sometimes my seed was cut in 1/2. I needed to do some house renovations so I pulled out the cash and invested in to my house. 


Back then for me... it was all about ETH, the functionality of smart contracts fascinated me. BTC, I have always felt it had no real utility other than a value holder, and that value could just as easily go to zero and 1 million. Yes... it seems like the functionality of ETH is only used for meme coin pump and dump, and we have not seen the ""killer app"" that would make it indispensable. 


Since tapping out, I don't have huge fomo because the majority of my holdings were ETH... but today i am looking at charts, and I have not been tuned in enough to understand why exactly ETH did not mirror BTC (it always had in the past).

Anyway, thanks",32

Completely new to crypto. I have been reading the posts for the last couple of months and learning a lot. 

I am intrigued by the crypto cycles. When you think the crypto winter is near, do you only sell your Alts, or do you also sell your Bitcoin and reinvest later on? 

On one end I understand about the pitfalls of trying to time the market, but why keep something that may potentially fall in value soon?

Do taxes play a role in your decision?

BTC,2025-01-15,post,CryptoMarkets,How Do You See the Bitcoin Movement After Trump Assumes Office?,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about how Bitcoin might react as President-elect Trump takes office. It’s trading around $97,000 right now, and analysts like Lark Davis are pointing out some interesting similarities to its behavior during the last election cycle. He’s highlighted three distinct phases Bitcoin went through back then, and with Trump’s pro-crypto stance, it feels like history could “rhyme” again.  
  
What really grabs my attention is Trump’s plan to reshape crypto regulations and even build a national Bitcoin reserve to tackle the $36 trillion debt. It’s a bold move that could bring more confidence to the market, something we didn’t see with the previous administration.  
  
On the technical side, Doctor Profit is optimistic too, saying Bitcoin needs to hold above $95,900 and break $97,500 to keep its momentum. With BTC already up 3% in the last 24 hours, the $100,000 mark doesn’t feel so far off anymore.  
  
I can’t help but wonder if this is Bitcoin’s moment to shine. What’s your take? could this political shift push BTC to new heights?",7

Pero yo creo que es improbable que sea un límite a largo plazo.

Es pura lógica: hay muchas posiciones en largo desde los 20K sin cerrarse y 120K es proporcional a los ciclos anteriores (es todo muy aproximado, pero mira la lógica -> 20x3 = 60, 60x2=120, 1x180, 4x60=240 ....), con lo que es posible que se use como plataforma para cerrar masivamente posiciones largas, lo que dé lugar a un retroceso importante, necesario para volver a acumular posiciones de compra (que tienen que realizarse a precios más bajos). He usado tu cifra, 120 de base, pero puedes sustituirla por valores reales, y también los puntos de rebote más relevantes para sacar proporciones.

Una vez el mercado haya acumulado, tendría que volver a aumentar los precios para vender, sobre 120K. Pero no antes.

En el subreddit no permiten imágenes, pero si te vas a las gráficas de futuros del Bitcoin (micro) y revisas el COT en la gráfica semana (nearby) en Barchart, verás que está a punto de caramelo casi. En concreto, el último ciclo de ventas institucionales comenzó en los 75K y no ha parado desde entonces. Por lo que los fondos y especuladores llevan comprando desde entonces.

BTC,2024-12-21,post,CryptoMarkets,Data science person for 10+ years. I mess around with predictive BTC models to make life interesting. This week's dip didn't really make a difference in model outcomes. ,"I focus on predicting the price of a thing (say, bitcoin) 1-100 days into the future, based on a bucket of features that includes past crypto price movements, the stock market, currencies, and other stuff that makes up the secret sauce.

A couple days before the election, my bitcoin model predicted a price of about $84k on February 1, 2025 (it was at about $69k at the time). The election and aftermath fucked it all up, and I've finally gotten back to the point where I'll bet that I have solid predictions in the new reality.

This model now expects a BTC price of $105,790 on Feb 1, 2025 and a price of $108,557 on March 29 (100 days forward). Perhaps more interestingly, it doesn't expect the price to rise all that much until the second half of January 2025. About a week ago, before the recent declines in price, the model predicted $104,253 on Feb 1. So, in other words, it doesn't really care about \~the dip\~.

R²: 0.9151 for those who care about that sort of thing.

I have a simple site where I post updates about this model, but not linking to it in the post because I'm not sure if that breaks the rules. I'll share in the comments if people are curious. And also: *all* market predictions are wrong.

BTC,2024-12-21,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Data science person for 10+ years. I mess around w...,"I no longer do ML but used to be heavy into it and spoke at an IEEE conference back in 2019. Predicting specific prices that far into the future is pure speculation, just because you ran a regression model and fed an algorithm data doesn't mean your prediction is any better than an arm chair guess.

The furthest any prediction model I'll actually believe is maybe a day or two into the future. You cannot predict outside events because you don't have access to that kind of data and processing power. You yourself said the election screwed you, that's just one glaring example as to why this is WAY more complicated than plotting some linear regression.

I love that you're trying but I moved away from this years ago because I realized that modeling any financial model is chasing the dragon, you'll always feel like you're close and sometimes it works but you'll never really trust it fully because it fails in an unpredictable way that ultimately undermines its very purpose. You're making an educated guess, yes it's educated but it's still a guess.",24

BTC,2025-06-23,post,CryptoMarkets,Iran  Approved Closing Strait of Hormuz - Bitcoin Bounces After $1B+ Liquidations... Here's My  Take,"Iran's Parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz ,, waterway that handles about 20% of global oil trade. Markets initially tanked... we saw $450 million in liquidations (some sources saying over $1B when you factor in all the cascading effects), and then... we bounced.

BTC currently sitting around $101K range after that initial drop…

Here's my  thesis :

Every. Single. War. Is. Manufactured.
Every big world scare is engineered to create these exact market conditions. They tank the markets, liquidate the overleveraged retail crowd, and then... whoosh... the printer gets turned on and they buy everything back at discount prices with freshly minted money.

Think about it logically... the final decision to close the strait lies with Iran's national security council, NOT the parliament. This is political theater designed to create volatility. Closing Hormuz would hurt Iran's own economy since they export through there too, and it would piss off China (their biggest oil buyer).

So why the vote? Because they NEED the fear narrative to justify the next round of monetary expansion.

Bitcoin's Role in All This:

BTC is going to be the primary beneficiary of this entire charade. While traditional markets get whipped by geopolitical nonsense, Bitcoin continues to prove it's the ultimate hedge against coordinated financial manipulation.

Analysts are projecting $100K-$120K trading range in the short term, but I think we're going much higher when the it all settles(if)  .The 2025 prediction range of $100K-$150K is looking conservative if my thesis is correct.

The liquidation flush we just saw? That's exactly what they wanted. Over $1.9 billion in liquidations across crypto derivatives over the past week according to some reports. I've been tracking all this volatility and the resulting trades through Awaken.tax they actually handles these complex DeFi positions and liquidation events properly,

UPDATE - 24 Hours Later:
And there it is. Trump announces an Israel-Iran ceasefire just as quickly as this escalated. The timing couldn't be more textbook,, create the crisis, flush out the overleveraged positions, then resolve it once the desired market effect is achieved;;

The Strait of Hormuz ""threat"" evaporated as predicted. Iran's parliament vote was never going to be the final word exactly as outlined above. The National Security Council holds that authority, and economic reality (their own oil exports + China relationship) made closure unlikely from the start...

Markets are already stabilizing, BTC holding strong above $100K, and the liquidation event served its purpose. The pattern repeats itself with precision: manufactured volatility, retail flushout, institutonal accumulation at discounted prices.",7
BTC,2025-06-23,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Iran  Approved Closing Strait of Hormuz - Bitcoin ...,Are you actually implying that Trump and the Iranian government (plus the Israel gov I guess) are somehow in league to pump your bags? Is this the power of BTC cultists?,53

BTC,2025-04-05,post,CryptoMarkets,"Bitcoin Poised for Violent Decoupling From Global Markets, Expert Says – Markets and Prices Bitcoin News","Bitcoin is primed for explosive growth as trade wars rattle global markets, with one expert forecasting a decisive break from equities and rising demand for decentralized assets.


Weiss also disputed the notion that bitcoin’s behavior mirrors the equity market, predicting a sharp break in correlation. “Bitcoin’s recent correlation with equities won’t last. A divergence is coming and it won’t be subtle,” he opined. His message reflects a broader view emerging among bitcoin advocates that the digital asset is maturing into an independent asset class, capable of acting as a hedge against systemic economic and political shocks.


This sentiment was echoed by Michael Saylor, executive chairman of software intelligence firm Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), which recently rebranded as Strategy. On April 4, Saylor offered similar comments about bitcoin’s divergence from risk-on assets. “Bitcoin trades like a risk asset short term because it’s the most liquid, salable, 24/7 asset on Earth. In times of panic, traders sell what they can, not what they want to. Doesn’t mean it’s correlated long-term—just means it’s always available,” he explained.


Weiss and Saylor, along with many others in the crypto industry, also drew attention to bitcoin’s insulation from protectionist trade policies, especially as President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on a large number of countries. “There are no tariffs on bitcoin,” Weiss noted. The statement has become a rallying point for digital asset supporters who argue that bitcoin’s lack of borders and centralized control shields it from the types of economic constraints affecting traditional investments. Proponents argue that bitcoin’s design and independence make it increasingly appealing in a climate shaped by tariffs, trade wars, and monetary intervention.",8

The ""violent decoupling"" argument is not an analytically rigorous prediction but a marketing tool aimed at reviving bullish sentiment after bear market,  attracting new investors to sustain the Ponzi-like structure and exploiting behavioral biases to generate liquidity for early holders. 

Weiss provides no economic model explaining why Bitcoin should decouple now. Correlation breakdowns in the past were short-lived.

So in short: Until Bitcoin demonstrates a consistent negative correlation with equities during crises, the ""hedge"" narrative remains marketing, not reality.",1

In another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/s/RpBFY4Wugy ) I asked a question what is your prediction for BTC price end of September.
Some people wrote an answer and some others wrote random teachings of Budha. Bla Bla.

That last post gave me an idea. On the first day of every month, I’ll ask for your best end-of-month BTC price prediction. I’ll only consider responses received in the first 24 hours, then update this post with average prediction while adding [LOCKED] prefix to title.

On the next first of the month, I’ll publish the actual price, the delta, and how the crowd did.

Today is March 16, 2025. As of now, BTC is at $84,000 (NYC time: 7:30 PM, March 16).

Drop your best March 31, 2025, 10:00 PM NYC time BTC price prediction in a single number (e.g., 130k or 130,000 USD).

⚠️ No reasoning. No disclaimers. No advice. Just a number.

I’ll only consider responses until 10:00 PM NYC time, March 17, 2025. Let’s see how this plays out.

Once tsla gets to a point where it doesnt have enough capital, lenders are calling, and such, thats when they would sell their BTC imo. 

Its kinda like how our grandparents(or at least mine) invested in gold as an inflation/crash protection measure, they would never sell that gold until the day before their bank would come to foreclose.

BTC,2025-05-28,post,CryptoMarkets,Everyone’s Watching Price. No One’s Watching Bitcoin’s Quantum Vulnerability.,"Bitcoin is sold as digital gold, a hedge against inflation, a symbol of freedom from central banks. But there’s one thing it’s not, and nobody in the media wants to admit it: Bitcoin is not built to survive the future.

We’re heading into a quantum age. Fast. And when real quantum computers arrive, they won’t just outperform classical systems—they’ll break them. Bitcoin included. Here’s why: every Bitcoin transaction relies on something called ECDSA, a cryptographic system that keeps your private keys secure. But once you send Bitcoin, your public key is exposed. In today’s world, that’s fine. But in a quantum world? That’s game over. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s can take your public key and calculate your private key. Just like that, the vault door swings open and anyone can take what’s inside.

It’s not theoretical. If you’ve ever sent Bitcoin, your wallet will be vulnerable when quantum computing hits scale. And because Bitcoin’s blockchain is public, the targets are already marked. All it will take is one breakthrough. Now here’s the real problem: Bitcoin can’t pivot. Changing its cryptographic system would require a hard fork, a messy, risky, slow process involving every miner, node, wallet, and exchange in the world. And if history has shown us anything, it’s that Bitcoin doesn’t like to change.

Meanwhile, agencies like the NSA, China’s tech ministry, and the U.S. NIST are openly working on post-quantum standards. The people building the future are getting ready. But Bitcoin? It’s stuck. Imagine waking up and $300 billion in Bitcoin has vanished. Not because of a market crash, but because it was simply taken. Instantly. No hacks. No brute force. Just quantum math.

Some projects are preparing for this future. XRP uses a different signature system (Ed25519) that’s harder for quantum computers to break and easier to upgrade if needed. Flare is modular and designed to evolve. Hedera (HBAR) is governed by a council of real companies who can act quickly and deploy updates without the chaos of community politics. Ethereum is still using the same ECDSA as Bitcoin, and with even more complexity under the hood.

But here’s where it gets bigger. We’re not just talking about faster computing. We’re talking about a total shift in what’s possible. Quantum communication, using entangled particles for instant, secure data transfer, is already being tested. Anti-gravity propulsion, long buried under black-budget secrecy, is starting to come into the public eye. Navy patents, declassified UAP footage, and whispered disclosures are surfacing. In that world, coins that take ten minutes to settle feel like horse-drawn carriages in the age of warp drives.

The next wave of infrastructure won’t just be faster. It’ll be physics-bending, frictionless, real-time, and planetary—maybe even interplanetary. We’ll need digital assets that can sync with light-speed systems. XRP, Flare, and Hedera are at least headed in that direction. Bitcoin isn’t. So while institutions, media, and ETFs keep hyping BTC as the final destination, the truth is that it’s a monument. A symbol. A closed system that can’t keep up.

When the world flips into quantum gear, the assets that were built to move, adapt, and integrate will keep running. Bitcoin will just sit there, valuable only to those who haven’t realized the vault has already been cracked. In the end, it wasn’t digital gold. It was glass.

⸻

TLDR:

Bitcoin isn’t ready for the quantum era. Once quantum computers mature, they’ll be able to reverse-engineer wallets from public transactions. There’s no fix in sight, just delay and denial. Meanwhile, assets like XRP, Flare, and Hedera are better positioned to survive in a world where quantum tech and anti-gravity systems change everything. BTC isn’t the future. It’s a fossil.

Let's use Willow (Google's state of the art quantum chip) as an example. Willow was a major milestone wrt error rates. The current generation still has 0 real-world applications like breaking encryption. There is no functionality other than proof of concept in being able to do some extremely specific tasks faster than modern computers. Many in computational mathematics do not consider RCS to even count as computations. 

Google's previous ""quantum"" processor, Sycamore, had 53 qubits (2019). Willow has 105 physical qubits. But wait - there's IBM's Condor, sitting at 1.121 physical qubits, making it the most advanced. Ok.

As an example, we will use Bitcoin - Cracking its ECC encryption requires ~1,500 logical qubits (millions of physical ones). IBM's most optimistic goals are to achieve 100.000 physical qubits by 2033. 

Cracking Bitcoin’s encryption would require millions of error-corrected qubits.The threat is multiple decades away, and Bitcoin can upgrade to quantum-resistant tech. The same applies to general security. 

Post-quantum algorithms will likely be integrated into any protocol before quantum computers pose a legitimate threat.

BTC,2025-05-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Everyone’s Watching Price. No One’s Watching Bitco...,"The reality is the entire problem could be easily fixed but would require centralized control of Bitcoin mining/transactions, which some are not a fan of. Obviously, you understand why they can't just adjust things to account for future-proof encryption as it would make all current mining operations futile and transactions would slow to a crawl.

The solution is easily resolved by a large investment from a company willing to take over all mining/transactions. This would be accomplished by working with the company currently managing the coin. Once they have developed the future-proof encryption this would need to be converted a format that can be utilized by D-Wave devices. The investor would then be able to purchase lets say 5-10 of the systems capable of handling 5000 quibits. The devices are exceptionally limited in their functionality due to being designed to perform a vary narrow set of mathematical operations, but that would be perfect.   
  
This would resolve the issue of current mining operations not being capable of processing the stronger encryption, and basically put them all out of business. Better yet the company that does this would maintain exclusive rights to handle all transactions for some number of years in order to recoup costs and make profit.

Everyone would cry about it for a little bit but it would prevent the use of Bitcoin from dwindling to nothing in the future. At least from the security perspective. 

Just in case someone is not familiar with D-Wave I am suggesting that lets say 5 devices are created which each handle 5000 quibits. This would mean they would collectively have 2\^25000 independent threads for handling the mining/transactions of Bitcoin. Honestly, don't know why this hasn't already been done.

Let say BTC is $120k, a 50% increase would take it to $180k. That would need \~ $1.2T. How big is $1.2T? Roughly equivalent to entire GPD of Russia, or about half the market cap of Amazon.  

This underscores just how much new capital would be required to push Bitcoin significantly higher from here. That kind of scale brings a natural limitation.  

**2. The Role of Monetary Policy:**  

During Quantitative Tightening, investors or institutions tend to invest in safer assets within their respective classes, such as gold, real estate, and the S&P 500. Bitcoin is considered the safest asset in the crypto space.  

In a Quantitative Easing environment, investors or institutions tend to explore riskier assets within their class, such as low cap stocks or altcoins.  

Now, the Federal Reserve is now in the process of ending QT, opening the door for potential QE soon.  

Currently, gold and real estate, two traditional hedges, are cooling down, a sign that liquidity may be preparing to move into more volatile assets.  

**3. Bitcoin and the Distribution Phase:**  

Bitcoin are entering a high risk distribution phase. If you’re tracking on chain data, long term wallet holders have started to take profits, a behavior commonly observed during elevated risk conditions.  

From both a structural and technical perspective and acknowledging that this interpretation may be somewhat controversial. 

The current phase appears to align with what Elliott Wave Theory describes as Wave 5, the final leg of a long-term impulse cycle. Wave 5 is often marked by slowing momentum, increased volatility, and signs of trend exhaustion.  

When we apply Fibonacci projection techniques commonly used in Elliott Wave analysis and consider broader macro conditions and BTC massive market cap, a reasonable estimate would place the top of this cycle somewhere between $130k and $165k. This could mark the completion of the current impulse structure before entering a broader consolidation or correction.  

Final Thought,   
Risker asset, Altcoins are lining up. ",2

Obviously they’ve been bleeding out slowly ever since, despite a decent price increase of the Bitpapa (probably due to cash flowing into memes). But how come now, a slight overreaction in bitcoin price causes an entire landslide in the alts market - over and over again.",16
BTC,2025-03-11,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Why are alts so sensitive to Bitcoin price changes...,"The perception towards alts has changed significantly.

In 2022, there are broadly two classes of ""non-institutional"" buyers for the alt market.

1. Traders who saw alts as the faster horse than Bitcoin. These are the types who leverage up alts as ""beta"" play on Bitcoin. They are also the types who create large swings as they get liquidated, or aggressively rotate their profit from one meta to another.
2. Retails who brought alts believing they are ""actual alternatives"" to Bitcoin. Back in 2022, retail still saw ""smart contract"" with a lot of hopium and optimism. Over the bear market, the reality hit them hard, the UX was bad, and the lack of real adoption in the smart contract, in addition, they got rugged hard by projects, some even got funded by reputable Web 2 companies and big VCs.

Category 2 is the group that does a lot of passive bidding and DCAing, helping alts buffer from BTC's fall. Darwinian forces did a good job on them and thinned the herd aggressively over the bear market—many have not come back.

Now you start to see type 1 becoming more dominant over time, while type 2 is declining. Consequently, you get more aggressive moves because type 1s don't hold and DCA, but they swing trade and do heavy leverage.

Also, the institutions seem unimpressed with the alt market and see a lot of correlation. Their participation in alts is much lower now than before.",7

However, miners will switch solely to transaction fees as incentives. The reason I mention advances in technology is because, by that time, the assumption is that computers will be far more energy-efficient. Which could offset the lower incentives miners would receive from just transaction fees. 

Also, someone mentioned that the transaction fee increases as well. This is where layer 2 technology would come in. Where transactions would occur off-chain, then settle periodically on the main blockchain. Which would lower congestion and keep the fees manageable. 

That's just the two things I can think of off the top of my head at the moment. Hopefully, it gives a different perspective to  your question

Edit: As far as the price goes, there will still be demand, especially with growing adoptions, and by that time, it could potentially be integrated so deeply in society that it would be impossible to shift away from it. Also, scarcity is always a factor that will continue to increase prices. 

So, in conclusion, miners will still play a significant role but their influence on the price will shift as they focus more on capitalizing from transaction fees. The price will mainly be driven by scarcity, demand, and adoption beyond that point.

Let’s break this down for you since you clearly didn’t do your homework. Let me help school you on your precious meme coin. The OG Meme coin. 

First off, Bitcoin being the “standard” is an outdated narrative. It had first mover advantage, sure, but that doesn’t mean it’s the gold standard of crypto. 

 In fact, even Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called Bitcoin a meme coin, because it has no real utility beyond speculation and storing value. That’s literally what meme coins are assets people buy based on belief rather than function. FACT. 

And let’s talk about scarcity. You seem to think all 21 million BTC will be in play, but that’s laughably wrong. Ofc. 

Roughly 20% of all Bitcoin is lost forever…gone, inaccessible, never to be touched again. So no, the market isn’t going to magically “clean up” as the price drops. The idea that BTC will somehow become so cheap that everyone just buys it all up ignores how real markets work. As well they’re still being mined. Try to understand your meme coin before trying to defend your meme coin. 

Meanwhile, the world is moving on to utility-based blockchains that actually do something. 

Bitcoin is like an old flip phone…yes, it was groundbreaking at first, but no one’s choosing it over a smartphone in today’s world. 

 You can keep clinging to outdated maxispeak, but the reality is clear: the industry has already evolved past Bitcoin. It’s still around, sure, but it’s no longer leading the way. The writing is on the wall. 

So, instead of coping with “Bitcoin is the standard,” maybe take a second to understand why the rest of the world isn’t buying into that anymore.",0

If Bitcoin strategic reserve is passed in January 2025 (maybe even on day 1 of Trump admin. via executive order), how would the price of BTC react „short term“ (lets say in the next few weeks)… ?

Was there ever any INTELLIGENT analysis…? I dont care about none-inteligent „we going to da moon bro“ type of useless brain dead s… Im sick of that kind of people…

Was there any INTELIGENT analysis backed up by data etc…? How far might the price reach lets say 2-4 weeks after SBR being passed…? Lets say the begging point is 110K… Could bitcoin almost 2x that in 4 weeks…?

I read about 250K being possible… Also Samson Meow has been on and on about „omega candle“ which he defines (i think) as a 100K (!) DAILY (!) Candle on BTC… I always found that stupid and laughable, but he possibly DOES have some Insider info since he has an organization that goes around ther world to nation states and lobbies for bitcoin adoption… So… Who might know more than he… ?

I always thought he „pulled it out of his a…“… But now… Im not so sure…

Also UAE (United arab emirates) has probably around 300K (or even more) bitcoin… USA might FOMO, China might FOMO, RUSSIA might FOMO… Is it really possible for the price to almost 2x (from 100K to 200K) in a matter of 2-4 weeks after the BTC SBR announcement in January… Anybody any INTELLIGENT (!) take on this, some analysis… Some numbers crouching…?

When Trump mentioned BTC SBR fist time in summer (?) of 2024 (i think in Nashville(?)) i was like – omg this is so stupid, hes just going after the votes of bitcoiners, thats all, he just promisses sh\*t for votes (every politican does that) and i did NOT at all understand the enthusiasm in BTC community, i found them NAIVE to the max… Trump was just posturing for votes and NOT planning to go ahead with it… Bitcoiners were just another voting block he was after , or so i thought…

But then he got elected… IF (!) he didnt mean to go through with the SBR, you would expect him and his circle to slowly „quiet“ the converstaion about the BTC SBR down, tone it down a lot, dont speak about it at all and slowly let people (hopingly) forget about it… YET (!) we have seen NO such thing (!). On the contrary, he (and his circle) go on and on about it… This is NOT (!) what you should do if you are planning to NOT pass the legislation (!).

That was like a WTF moment for me… 3rd realization is that Trump SUPPOSEDLY mentioned „Bitcoin is the new oil“… That was also quite WTF for me (Google the significance of this if you do not understand, 4th realization is Trump is NOT (!) that wealthy for him to pass on possible bitcoin gains (!). Trump is what, like measly 5,5 billion net worth (and is that NET?) how much of that is „real“, how much of that is liquid… My point being Trump is NOT (!) so wealthy that he could ignore BTC (like MUSK for example) and i believe he looks at BTC as many „normal people“ do – as a Fo\*king opportunity to at least DOUBLE his bags (!). I believe Trump IS IN BITCOIN in some way and will HUGELY benefit if he passes SBR… And now he has a SHI\* TONE of PERSONAL,motivation, PURE and TRUE motivation to actually pass SBR… This is a point i have NEVER heard anywhere else (!).

All this in conclusion – i really think we are getting SBR… Maybe even in January… Maybe even on day 1… Trump has his OWN, PURE, MOTIVATION – MONEY (!). (and greed, and there is nothing wrong with that, it just makes the whole scenario MUCH more likely and realistic (!).",1

Retail holders will see this with the price appreciation and will not want to sell, and others will fomo in due to it being inevitable now.

This is for those who will look back at the charts and think ""if only I bought there"" The Fed is printing 30 billion dollars starting today to give liquidity ti the markets. Interest rates are expected to start cutting aggressively starting in September which also adds liquidity. We are currently in a liquidity cycle that should peak around late 2025 which oddly enough coincides with BTCs 4 year cycle. We are at an all time high in Global liquidity currently. Bitcoin on exchanges is at a 5 year low, we had halving 5 months ago and miners cost to mine is continuing to rise. RSI is at the exact level we were are last cycle in September which was right before the bull run got crazy . And halving was a month difference so this years August is last cycles September . I can taste how close this thing is to going crazy. Don't get shaken out . But buy buy buy. And don't forget some of those beaten down alts. They should go wild as well .

Volume climbed and recent candle piercing $120K suggests more upside. I’m eyeing $115,411 as support and $123,214 as the next resistance— a break could push us to $125K.

Recently, I’ve noticed that Bitcoin has been in an uptrend over the past few days, setting a new ATH each time, while many altcoins have been moving in the opposite direction, dropping by more than 20% for some. 

Is there any particular reason behind this? Can this trend be explained, and are there any insights you can share?

TIA!",19
BTC,2024-11-21,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Bitcoin/Altcoin Price Divergence...,"It’s called BTC dominance.

People are selling their other crypto and putting it into BTC.

This also includes converting or swapping other crypto into BTC.

It happens every cycle.

This cycle is different as BTC is now seen by many countries/institutions/banks as a legit store of value.

This is causing a mass FOMO on a larger scale, not retail FOMO but commercial FOMO.

Also, $100,000 is a nice number and humans like numbers like this. $100, $1,000 etc. 

When BTC hits $100,000 it will be all over the news everywhere possibly generating another massive wave of investors thinking “oh shit, this BTC thing is real… I better jump in finally!”",35
BTC,2024-11-21,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Bitcoin/Altcoin Price Divergence...,"Usually cycles go like this:

BTC rises, BTC Dominance rises, everything else stagnates -> ETH Rises -> Bitcoin has its second run -> Alts go completely bonkers, people become super greedy and wont sell because they plan on selling at price target X and ""we are in a bullrun"" -> Everything dips hard and greedy people that have no experience in crypto cycles lose their money.

Atleast when the past cycles are any indicator.

This cycle however could be different. If countries decide they need a strategic BTC reserve, we might end up with a supercycle or get no bearmarket at all. Alts will however dump no matter what, once the greed is too high",14

-Flow of money moves into Bitcoin causing prices surges
-Ethereum goes back and forth with bitcoin and starts outperforming it

-Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin and we hear talks of the flippening

Phase 3: Large Caps
-Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin and large caps are going parabolic
Phase Regardless of market cap, some altcoins with strong fundamentals Overlap are having pumps

Phase 4: Altseason
-Large caps have gone full vertical and we’re seeing blow off tops

Even the most predictable Altcoins can trade against BTC given the many variables that drive markets. 

There is money to be made with cryptos that tend to swing with BTC's price fluctuations. ESPECIALLY during crashes. 

Trade if you want to, but DCA and buying dips is a proven strategy when trading sideways or in a bear market. 

Research your alts and determine a strategy. I like AVAX, SOL, and FET. They tend to trade with BTC, so when BTC drops 10, these alts drop 20 or more. That's a good buy.",2

# Summary

* Bitcoin appears to have bottomed after testing its 200-day Simple Moving Average, positioning it for a large rally.
* Short term resistance at $60k has been surpassed, with the next level at 65k.
* Monthly chart projections suggest a potential rally to $300k.
* Bitcoin continues to evolve as a new form of value storage.

As anticipated by my [last article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703317-bitcoin-bottoming-or-breaking-technical-analysis?hasComeFromMpArticle=false&source=section%253Amain_content%257Cbutton%253Abody_link), Bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD?hasComeFromMpArticle=false&source=section%253Amain_content%257Cbutton%253Abody_link)) appears to have bottomed after testing its 200-day Simple Moving Average in much the same way as it did in September, leading to a large rally

There’s only currently 1.2 trillion worth of BTC out there. If we pay to acquire most of it you’ll be running up the price on ourselves and then the thing that makes BTC worth anything is that one day someone will pay more for it than you did like a Ponzi scheme. Almost all other non-meme crypto do what BTC does but better so its value isn’t for application. So if you run the price up a ton while buying it  to just acquire more debt in the accumulation process but then who’s gonna want to pay for it at such an exorbitant amount. Once 99.99% of people are priced out it basically dies like any other Ponzi that can’t find new buyers to replace the old ones. What makes it work right now is that there’s a lot of fluctuation in its price or else it’s already getting priced too high. Everyone that bought is just waiting for it to go to 100k+ now and are just trying to convince everyone they know to buy so the price goes up from here. Nobody wants to buy the top so it’s having a hard time currently. If people truly thought it’d go to 100k it’d already be there.,0

BTC,2025-03-14,post,CryptoMarkets,"Bitcoin right now: Different price, Same guarantees. See this as an opportunity.","I've been in the Bitcoin world since 2016.

Over those years, I've seen the price of Bitcoin plummet, and soar, I don't know how many times.

Each time, those who don't understand why Bitcoin exists panic.

They lose faith in the Bitcoin revolution because they haven't bought for the right reasons, or because they haven't studied Bitcoin enough to develop the strength of conviction needed in this unique revolution.

There's nothing extraordinary about seeing the price of Bitcoin fall from $109K to $77K. It's entirely logical and to be expected.

The price of Bitcoin could fall even further. It won't change my view of Bitcoin as long as the fundamentals of the Bitcoin revolution are still there. And they are still there.

With Bitcoin, the price is different right now, but [**the guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol are the same**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/the-10-incredible-guarantees-the):

* There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
* 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
* An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
* A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
* A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
* Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
* A permanently available network (Uptime > 99.989% since Bitcoin creation)
* A never-hacked network
* The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable
* The Bitcoin code is open-source

There's no need to panic. Think of it as an opportunity.",3

BTC,2025-03-14,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Bitcoin right now: Different price, Same guarantee...","It’s funny how btc maxis keep repeating the same talking points without ever answering the most important question:..

What does Bitcoin actually offer besides speculation?… what? 

Sure, the supply is capped at 21 million. So what? Scarcity alone doesn’t create value…utility does. 

 You talk about Bitcoin’s security and uptime, but none of that changes the fact that it’s extremely slow, extremely expensive, and completely useless in a world shifting to real utility-driven assets. 

 Bitcoin’s proof of work mining isn’t a feature…it’s a huge flaw. Each Bitcoin transaction consumes around 1,200 kWh of electricity, which is more than an average U.S. household uses in over a month. A month! …And for what? To transfer digital nothingness at a snail’s pace with massive fees? Let’s be honest. Most don’t have a clue how much electricity btc wastes. 

Even Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, labeled Bitcoin a meme coin. That wasn’t a slip-up…it was an admission that Bitcoin is nothing more than a storefront for speculation. That’s it. 

 That’s why it was isolated in its own reserve, separate from real utility tokens. 

 The world is moving toward ISO 20022-compliant tokens…the ones that actually solve financial problems. 

For example…XRP, there’s a reason it’s know as the “Banker’s token” around the world for many years.  maxis despise that. 

 Meanwhile, Bitcoin is like a flip phone in a world that’s already moved on to smartphones. Don’t get me wrong, It will always have its title as the OG meme coin, but other than that…it literally offers the world nothing. 

So again, what does Bitcoin actually offer? Besides high fees, energy waste, and a community that’s still coping with the fact that their digital rock has no purpose? 

I’ll never understand the hate/envy/jealousy btc maxis have towards real world Utility tokens, especially ISO20022 compliant tokens.",6

BTC,2024-11-21,post,CryptoMarkets,Just a warning for new crypto people. Take it or leave it.,"Just warning the newcomers, take it or leave it.

All of these $skibidirizzohiopoop coins will never make you rich. I'll rephrase it to gambling. You are just gambling, and if you are not the house, like the devs or the platform hosting the exchange, you will lose, because the house always wins. 

For you to buy a coin, someone has to be selling it. Someone is always is going to hold the bag. 

If you do a little research, you'll see that, oddly enough, all of these coins, meme and alt, are tied to the same block chains and markets as the bigger coins. These coins are ONLY based on market sentiment. I.e. BTC did not do anything but be hyped up. It will hit 100k ONLY because everyone wants it to hit 100k. That's not investing. 

Crypto is going to go somewhere, yes. We will likely use a decentralized block chain as a new way to regulate fiat money like the dollar or euro. But not even BTC will be that coin. 

If you want to make money on the market, you are not too late. Pick a big boy coin, buy it and don't sell it. The red is coming. Most of you at this point will have to wait for the next run. If you look at any market, you'll see we entered a bull market in 2020, and it crashed 2021. It's up now, but it will end. If you end up buying the top, just wait a few years.

BTC,2025-02-25,post,CryptoMarkets,Why I think Trump’s admin is bad for Bitcoin and crypto,"Bitcoin started as this wild, anti-establishment experiment. It is (or at least - was) a rebel move against the traditional finance system where you could flex your independence without banks or governments breathing down your neck. Back in the day, the internet was all about counting Bitcoin “deaths” like it was a meme-worthy horror show, proving no one really believed it would make it. Yet, it made it.

Fast forward, and now the big dogs - financial institutions and governmental entities  - are all over it, pumping in over 60% of the trading volume and billions of dollars into the game. This isn’t your scrappy, decentralized dream anymore - it’s become another ticker on Wall Street. The disregard and obituaries turned into institutionalized bullish sentiments. When BlackRock’s CEO drops a bomb price target of $700k, it’s a clear sign that Bitcoin’s metamorphosing from a symbol of freedom into a mainstream, profit-chasing commodity, which is kinda crushing that raw, anarchistic vibe it once had.

Institutional hype is stripping away Bitcoin's original countercultural mojo. But institutions, now controlling the market, won't be satisfied with just a dream. They want application and utility. They want a tangible future. The long-term dream will slowly erode under the weight of reality, exposing that there is nothing beneath Bitcoin that could be considered a true asset. At least In my view. ",0

 When institutions control the liquidity, it stops being a tool of financial freedom and becomes just another Wall Street asset. Even Coinbase’s CEO recently called Bitcoin a meme coin, the OG meme coin imo..highlighting that it offers nothing beyond speculation.

The bigger issue is that Bitcoin is outdated tech…like an old flip phone in a world moving toward smartphones. The future of crypto isn’t just about holding an asset..it’s about real world utility.

BTC,2025-03-09,post,CryptoMarkets,"Bitcoin to rapidly grow in price again soon? Looking at the price chart, I think I see a patter represented by BTC reaching an ATH, then being stagnant or dipped for some time, and then reaching another ATH. Do you also see that pattern or is it just me?","Go to Google search and type ""BTC price"", then click on ""All time"" (this is to zoom-out fully), and take a look at the chart.

So, do you see a pattern indicating another bull run is coming? When I look at the chart, I see a cycle that began in the early 2020, and goes that way:

Stage 1: A rapid price growth, reaching an ATH.

Stage 2: Staying stagnant or dipped for some time.

Stage 3: Begins to grow in price again, reaching another ATH.

The cycle, as shown by the patterns, has been repeated 2 times, with a bear market between the first 2 high green candlesticks and the next 2 green candlesticks that are higher than the first 2 candlesticks. So, I believe a third and fourth green candlestick will be erected soon, being higher than the first and second 2 candlesticks.

So, is this an actual pattern indicating another price growth is coming soon and I'm leaving the Matrix, or it's just my brain producing copium for me?

Is there a real pattern or it's just me seeing patterns that aren't really there?",0

BTC,2025-04-16,post,CryptoMarkets,Trump buying BTC? Miners may be the front door.,"Bo Hines (Trump’s Digital Asset advisor) just floated the idea that the U.S. could buy BTC using tariff revenues. That’s a wild thought, but if it ever materializes, you have to imagine regulators and institutions will lean on “trusted” public companies — especially compliant miners.

That’s where $MARA and $RIOT could benefit. But I’d argue $CANG deserves attention too. They’ve gone full crypto after spinning off their old China business, and are already outperforming in production efficiency. Unlike the heavy capex models, they partner with Bitmain and host globally — which gives them flexibility.

Plus, they’re holding BTC instead of dumping it — over 1,900 coins and growing. If the government ever does buy BTC, they’ll need secure, auditable supply routes. Public miners may become strategic assets.

Alt season ? There was only 2 instance of that in 2017 and 2021, and the expression ""alt season"" is extremely misleading, 99.9% of alts didnt pump or even crashed during these ""alt seasons"".  
So not only altseason is not an establish trend at all, but also, alt season doesn't mean what people, especially newcomers, think it means. On top of that, alts magnitude in crypto have been in a diminishing trend compared to bitcoin since 2017, when they were at their highest.

XRP ? Xrp has massive community of bag holders, and newcomers, its very unfortunate to get caught in the fad. The institutional adoption they are speaking of is just not happening and has been touted since 2017. In fact, if you had done some research, you'd have seen that XRP had its ATH in January 2018, and basically never ever recovered that ATH since. This is is a terrible track record, just in the charts. On top of that, there are actually too many reasons why it is a massively over estimated coin at the moment, centralized, ripple selling tokens to keep afloat, constant misinformation, XRPL being basically controlled by Ripple, a for profit company, in spite of what anyone might tell you.

Lastly, there is only one coin that has kept thriving accross all cycles, in fact cycles are literally built around it, and it is bitcoin. Anything else is a gamble, that has short lived pumps.

The board are saying to vote no, but if the price explodes between now and then theres no logical reason not to vote yes. The balance sheet of the company would grow without the need to sell anything like microstratgy. If Microsoft buy in the price movement would be even more to the high side and we could be looking at heading towards ATH in the several hundred thousands as they would no doubt not be the only company to do this.

BTC,2024-08-12,post,CryptoMarkets,"Bullish Indicator Resurfaces as Bitcoin Stabilizes Above $60,000","A market cycle indicator for Bitcoin, which tracks investor sentiment phases, has recently flashed a bullish signal after previously turning bearish for the first time since January 2023, following Bitcoin's drop below $50,000.

On August 5, 2024, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $49,751, known as ""Crypto Black Monday,"" marking the first drop below $50,000 since February.

This decline prompted the bull-bear cycle indicator to shift into the ""Bear"" or bearish zone. However, the indicator has since turned bullish again as Bitcoin managed to stabilize above $60,000.

According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin traded below the key $60,000 level until August 8, 2024. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was priced at $60,732, reflecting a 0.35% decrease over the past week.

The last bearish signal from the Bitcoin bull-bear cycle indicator occurred in January 2023, shortly after the collapse of FTX. Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index recorded an “Extreme Fear” score of 17 on August 6, the lowest since the FTX crash. However, this score later rebounded to a “Neutral” level of 48.

Some Bitcoin traders believe this rapid price reversal suggests that the recent price drop might have been a bear trap—a situation where experienced traders deliberately sell Bitcoin to temporarily lower asset prices and trap short sellers.

On the other hand, analysts have differing views on Bitcoin's next market direction. On August 7, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, suggested that Bitcoin's target price might fall into the low $40,000 range before the next bull market begins.

Conversely, a report from Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest on August 6 indicated that crucial support levels for Bitcoin are at $52,000 and $46,000.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt also noted that Bitcoin’s recent decline since the halving resembles the 2015-2017 bull market cycle, implying the potential for a subsequent bull run.

With the bull-bear cycle indicator now showing a bullish signal and Bitcoin’s price stabilizing above $60,000, there is optimism that the Bitcoin market might enter a sustained bullish phase, although analysts remain divided on short- and medium-term trends.

BTC,2025-02-22,post,CryptoMarkets,Is Bitcoin Still Bullish? Shocking Chart Says Long-Term Uptrend Intact,"The blue line connects the historical highs of BTC, showing a distinct long-term upward trend that has yet to be broken. Currently, we are consolidating within the Fibonacci reversion level (0.382–0.618; approximately 88,000–102,000), as seen in the color band. The upward trend remains the same on the daily chart and there is no significant reversal signal yet.



Fibonacci levels: BTC has been hovering between 88,000 (0.618) and 102,000 (0.382), suggesting a healthy correction after the recent rally. Such a sideways move is common for bull market pauses.



Trendline: The blue line (historical high) acts as a dynamic support line. The bullish structure holds as long as the price remains above it.

Volume And Momentum: Volume is stable, but MACD shows some bearish divergence, but it's not enough to signal a breakthrough in the trend.



Conclusion: BTC's long-term uptrend is still alive and vibrant. The consolidation is expected to be resolved with a breakthrough of 102,000, potentially targeting new highs.

Delta hedging is an options trading strategy that aims to reduce, or hedge, the directional risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset. The approach uses options to offset the risk to either a single other option holding or an entire portfolio of holdings.

If the stock market crashes by a large amount I would expect BTC to go down proportionately further.

I believe there will be a huge crash this year. It could be any day or it may take its time coming. The whale’s bet is not crazy. And, it doesn’t have to be tied to expected bad news. This could easily be someone playing the odds.

I have moved significantly to cash in recent months (and increasingly not the dollar).

BTC,2025-03-03,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Crypto stocks rally, bitcoin jumps as Trump touts ...","Crypto stocks rallied in early trading Monday after President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social [that his administration will create a US crypto reserve](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-relieves-crypto-slump-with-new-promises-about-a-us-reserve-145238382.html).

In [a post on Truth Social on Sunday](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114093526901586124), Trump said the US crypto reserve would include bitcoin, Ether ([ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD)), XRP ([XRP-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRP-USD)), Solana ([SOL-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOL-USD)), Cardano ([ADA-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADA-USD)). Trump had [previously issued an executive order to create a national crypto “stockpile”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-executive-order-to-establish-united-states-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) but did not name which cryptocurrencies would be included.

Strategy ([MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR)), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin formerly known as MicroStrategy, rose 12% while crypto miners Riot Platforms ([RIOT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIOT)) and MARA Holdings ([MARA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MARA)), formerly known as Marathon Digital, jumped 7% and 9%, respectively. Coinbase ([COIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN)) climbed 3.5%.

“A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” Trump [wrote in the Truth Social post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114093526901586124). “I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

“And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” he [added in a separate post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114093946326587357).

Bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD)) rose nearly 9% Monday to more than $92,000.

The jump comes after bitcoin saw [its worst month in February since June 2022](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-falls-nearly-17-in-february-to-cap-worst-month-since-june-2022-220812447.html), dropping roughly 17% as [the so-called Trump trade lost steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-trump-crypto-rally-is-fading-174300635.html).",1

Social media only has ""finfluencers"" screaming BULLRUN left with 95% of the interaction being bots. Altcoins have failed and Bitcoin is absorbed into the traditional system. Long term holders have won, the rest has lost","When i first heard about Bitcoin in late 2012 ($8/12 range) it INSTANTLY clicked for me. Why pay a ridiculous Paypal fee when you can just buy some bitcoin and send it directly to the other person worldwide. It was a nobrainer.

Along with each cycle came a wave of altcoins, every cycle more and more. The older i have become and the more cycles i have seen each one became more ridiculous. We went from cryptokitties to nft's to full meme coin casino. Every cycle the promises have become bigger and more ridiculous. And more and more bad faith actors have jumped onboard of the train.

**Its time to face some harsh truths in my opinion that many here refuse to see.**

* **Bitcoin has failed its intended purpose, but has a place in the finance world that gives it value**. 99% doesnt use it to send money P2P. Its absorbed into ETF form and used as a speculative asset where only the $$$ value matters. It being a form of hard money is the only savior in the narrative left and even that is becoming a thin line. At this point its just a tech asset following the broad market.
* **Bitcoin wont make you rich anymore,** **and thats exactly why people load up more and more risk in form of casino altcoins each cycle:** The early days are over, diminishing returns are kicking in hard. It speaks for itself when measured from peak to peak. I have stocks that did better than my Bitcoin DCA I bought at end of 2022 (16/17k range).
   * First cycle: $32 --> $1242 (39x)
   * Second cycle $1242 --> $19796 (16x)
   * Third cycle $19796 --> 68990 (3.5x)
   * Current $68990 --> 110k (1.6x)
   * **Bottom to peak shows the same diminishing returns** (544x | 100x | 20x | 7x)
      * I have no clue why people assume bitcoin will reach 300/500k this cycle.
* **Trump brings a huge systemic risk to crypto/bitcoin, even if it outlives his term/life**: Altcoins literally got saved by Trump's announcement end '24. They were already bleeding out. Bitcoins current cycle was probably accelerated because of it. ***The market priced in perfection***\*\*.\*\* (Perfect ETF's / world reserve etc. the whole package) But it all came crashing down when Trump showed his true colors. When he released his own coin all red flags should have gone up. He doesnt really care about crypto, he cares about his own wallet, ego and power. And that is problematic, cause even if bitcoin is not controlled by Trump, YOU GUYS made him the posterboy as ""pro crypto president"". And now the rest of the world gets to see what that means. Why you applauded a pro-crypto president like him to begin with baffles me. USA is getting dismantled and you all think he wont take crypto a peg down with him?
* **MSTR/Saylor is a huge risk:** Speaks for itself. Very cool to link a factsheet with 80 companies holding bitcoin, but its pretty bleak. And i just dont trust a dude who has blown up his company in the dot com bubble and now attaches his entire company to shilling Bitcoin. Its not organic adoption. Yes you can fault me on this point, its a gut feeling. Same way Elon turned out to be a \*\*\*\*\*\*. Crypto bro's got used to get votes / popularity. Now people burn cars from his brand.
* **99.99% Altcoins are garbage:** Yes in a few weeks or months people will come here to write dumb messages to tell me how wrong i was cause they made a nice 300% return on the weekly with SafePepe420xxxMoon coin. That doesnt mean you are investing. Go take a look in the waybackmachine and see the top 50 coins in 2017 / 2021. If you think you can pick the next blue chip altcoin, good luck. You cant. Especially not with the millions being pumped out yearly now.
* **Social media is getting fragmented more, this halts adoption**: Social media was a great tool to have new people get involved with new ideas. But now its turning into a very splintered / fragmentated landscape where everybody is screaming in their own room. Unable to leave that part almost without doing quite some effort. This halts adoption and at this point most crypto places are just bag holders screaming to other bag holders. Innovative content is lost in the sea of junk.

Disclaimer: I will still hold Bitcoin, and will buy deeper downturns. But the gravy train is officially over. Bitcoin wont be the golden boy anymore. ITS UP 18% since the peak from 2021 after holding for 3+ years. It didnt even outpace inflation during that time.... Wake up.",451

Crypto subreddit are ""dead"" ...","I'm probably a bit younger in the game than you, but ever since I started reading crypto forums, the dream and mantra was larger and larger adoption. Widespread popularity, institutions, and eventually governments. And now we are finally here!

Now, it should have been obvious that the exponential increase in price would plateau. In fact, a more stable price is not failure, it's another sign of success. That in turn will make it feasible to use it for normal transactions, as opposed to speculation.

I might be wrong, but I think small item purchases was never really on the plate nor realistic for Bitcoin. There will be other systems covering that scenario. Again, I don't really see this as failure a Bitcoin.

If BTC can deliver on the promise as a store-of-value over time, hedging against fiat inflation, for the people who are getting in right now, that will already be tremendous success. If it can force financial accountability and constraint upon governments, it will a turning-point in economic history. So that's maybe a bit too much to hope for right now.

Even the big growth plan seems geared around governments buying in (Microstrategy, strike, bitpay, etc.).

I thought that when BTC was all mined, it would be more efficient and take less power, but then I found out it would still require mining to transfer (and fees would be increased massively to cover the energy costs, or miners might try to dump their supplies and get out...

(however, this can be alleviated by other cryptos tokenising Bitcoin)

People neglect to tell new investors that when BTC went from 60k to 20k, it took around 850 days to get back to 60… and then it went to where it is now at 105k...

Buying at the top can mean not being in the green for well over 2 years 

(also, from 60 - 105 is not even a 2x return, while selling and buying after hitting the base of the bear market could have seen closer to 5x returns)",1

BTC,2025-01-27,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Exit SAB 121, Banks Are About to Enter the Bitcoin...","Exit SAB 121. This SEC accounting standard was a major obstacle to the adoption of Bitcoin by banks.

With the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, regulations are changing and banks will be able to enter the world of Bitcoin.

At first glance, this represents a massive opportunity for mass adoption of Bitcoin. Customers of these banks will be able to access Bitcoin. Bitcoin will no longer be seen as something dangerous.

Nevertheless, as always, this kind of opportunity comes with major risks. The risk is that banks will resume their role as intermediaries in the new Bitcoin system. In which case, what's the point?

Bitcoin is here to free us from these banksters, not to give them back their role as intermediaries, as in the current system.

However, we also have to wonder whether people want the self-sovereignty that Bitcoin can provide. Some simply don't want to take on this responsibility.

BTC,2025-01-25,post,CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin bear market predicted between May and October 2025,"Finbold-derived cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez predicts that Bitcoin could enter a bear market between May and October 2025. This prediction is based on historical trends following Bitcoin halving cycles. Martinez notes that Bitcoin reached market peaks 367, 526 and 547 days after the 2012, 2016 and 2020 halvings. Currently, 276 days have passed since the 2024 halving. In the meantime, trading expert Trader Tardigrade suggests a market peak by March 2025 with a price target of USD 170,000. The forecasts are made against a backdrop of positive regulatory developments under President Donald Trump, including a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a new SEC task force. Bitcoin's price stability above USD 100,000 is crucial, with a key support level at USD 97,877. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $104,280, showing a decline of 1.1% in the last 24 hours.",1
BTC,2025-01-25,post,CryptoMarkets,BTC Price May Be at Risk Amid Trump Team Crypto Scandal and Proposed Bitcoin Bill,"The crypto world has been hit with shocking allegations involving former President Donald Trump and his team, leaving Bitcoin (BTC) investors on edge. While Bitcoin's price remains relatively stable for now, the potential for a dramatic market shift looms large as rumors swirl about a scandal and a new Bitcoin-related federal proposal. Here's the full story.

# Trump’s Alleged Crypto Scandal

Over the past few months, reports have surfaced alleging that members of Trump’s inner circle were involved in a cryptocurrency project that misled investors. The project, marketed as a groundbreaking investment, leveraged Trump’s influence and political clout to pump its value. But now, accusations are flying that the project was nothing more than a pump-and-dump scheme, with insiders selling off their holdings as the coin’s price peaked, leaving everyday investors holding the bag.

Blockchain analysts and whistleblowers claim to have traced some of the profits to Trump-affiliated entities, although no formal charges have been filed. Trump himself has yet to address these allegations directly, but his legal team has dismissed the claims as “politically motivated nonsense.”

# The Bitcoin Bill Proposal: A Strategic Play?

Amid the controversy, Trump made waves this week by proposing a new federal Bitcoin initiative. His bill calls for the U.S. government to begin acquiring Bitcoin as a “safe haven asset” to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The proposal positions BTC as an essential component of America’s financial future.

Here’s where things get interesting: some analysts believe the bill’s timing could be part of a broader strategy. While Bitcoin prices are currently stable, rumors of market manipulation are rampant. Critics argue that Trump and his allies may have plans to drive Bitcoin’s price lower in the coming days, potentially through coordinated sell-offs or other tactics, making it easier for large players—or even the government—to accumulate Bitcoin at a discount.

The crypto community is speculating whether this proposal is a genuine attempt to adopt Bitcoin or a calculated move to benefit those in Trump’s orbit.

# The Calm Before the Storm?

For now, the BTC market hasn’t reacted strongly to the news, but many investors are bracing for potential turbulence. “The allegations are serious, and if Trump’s team is involved in anything shady, it could shake investor confidence,” one Reddit user posted on r/cryptocurrency. “Even if the bill has good intentions, it might spook the market.”

Others see an opportunity amid the chaos. “If the government starts buying Bitcoin, it’s a long-term bullish signal, even if prices dip in the short term,” another user argued.

# What’s Next?

While Bitcoin remains stable for now, the situation is fluid, and a significant market shift could occur if the allegations against Trump’s team gain traction—or if large-scale sell-offs occur. The crypto market has weathered its share of scandals, but the combination of political drama and regulatory uncertainty could make this situation uniquely volatile.

As the story develops, crypto enthusiasts and investors alike are left wondering: is this a genuine push for Bitcoin adoption, or are we witnessing another example of high-level market manipulation?

What’s your take? Is the market bracing for a crash, or is this just another day in the unpredictable world of crypto? Share your thoughts below!",1
BTC,2025-01-18,post,CryptoMarkets,A Bullish Impulse Towards $140K Can Be Expected for Bitcoin If the $108K ATH Is Breached.,,7
BTC,2025-01-24,post,CryptoMarkets,Are We Already at the End of Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle? 🧐,"To me, it seems evident that we’re nearing the end of Bitcoin’s bull cycle. Sure, there might still be room for a small push upward, but looking at historical patterns, I believe we’re close to the top.   
Here’s my reasoning:  
  
**Time since the last bear market:**  
It’s been quite a while since Bitcoin exited the last bear market, and the current price behavior shows similarities to the final stages of the 2021 cycle. Based on historical trends, we’re approaching a timeframe that aligns with previous cycle peaks.  
  
**Less volatility this cycle:**  
This cycle seems less explosive compared to previous ones, likely due to the market’s maturity and the increasing presence of institutional investors. I speculate that in the next bear market, we might see solid supports between $35k and $45k, representing a 55%-65% drop from the peak. This aligns with the trend of higher lows in bear markets over time.  
  
**The FOMO is gone:**  
We’ve already experienced the hype at the start of this cycle, with news such as the U.S. elections and Bitcoin spot ETFs. However, the market now seems to be losing some of that excitement. While Q1 may remain relatively flat, I believe Q2 could bring higher volatility and potentially mark the end of this bull market.  
  
**What to expect now?**  
While another upward move is possible, I no longer believe this cycle will be as explosive as previous ones. The market seems to be consolidating in a more sustainable way, which might mean fewer extreme peaks and less dramatic drops.  


Do you think we’re truly at the end of the bull cycle, or does Bitcoin still have room to hit new highs?  
Does this cycle feel less volatile to you, or is it just a pause before another big move?  
What are your predictions for the bottom of the next bear market?

BTC,2024-11-27,post,CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin and Cardano Interoperability: Potential Impact on Cardano's Value,"A new technology, Bitcoin OS, will allow the verification of zero-knowledge proofs directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This will allow developers to build smart contracts on Bitcoin and connect it to other blockchains, such as Cardano. Cardano is a blockchain built with a UTXO architecture like Bitcoin but has more advanced smart contract capabilities. This shared architecture will make bridging between the two chains efficient.

The use of zero-knowledge proofs means that computation can be done off-chain on Cardano, while the results are still verified on Bitcoin. This could allow Bitcoin to access decentralised finance (DeFi) applications on Cardano. Bitcoin holders will be able to use their Bitcoin to interact with DeFi applications while their assets remain secure on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Cardano could see a significant increase in its Total Value Locked (TVL) if Bitcoin users begin to utilize its smart contract capabilities. If just 1% of Bitcoin's \$1.3 trillion market cap were to move to Cardano, it would result in a 40x increase in Cardano's TVL. This suggests that the integration of Bitcoin and Cardano has the potential to significantly increase the value of Cardano.

BTC,2025-02-13,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Am I paranoid or will one of these cycles be the l...,"This is just the beginning.

This technology is the first time humanity has ever experienced this digital eqiuvalent of physical ownership. Technology where an item can be created with unchangable properties. Bitcoin is the first and most decentralised, rapidly rising hashrate, 50k+ nodes, cementing its unchangability and resiliance.

You can transfer wealth from A to B permissionlessly, without a corporation in the middle. That's its utility, and it will always be required, the digital equivalent of handing someone a physical coin. No bullshit no questions asked transfers. No bullshit unchangable hard-cap.

EDIT: I wanted to expand further on the 'utility' component in terms of mining. Bitcoin positioning as a world reserve currency (or atleast a major asset tracking global finance in its entirety). The need to mine creates massive demand for more efficient chip production. The need to mine creates demand for cheaper, green energy production (green energy solutions with a one-time setup cost then constant free energy are a better mining investment than forever burning renewables). Bitcoin mining furthers developments in energy and technology.

Quantum computers are still a ways away from cracking ECDSA and SHA256 (an address which has never been spent from is protected by both of these - a 'spent from' address is protected by ECDSA only). When these are cracked so is encryption of the entire internet. We will see a revolution.

Quantum computers breaking Bitcoin is not something to be feared, it's something to be excited about. The blockchain can be restored from a date prior to the incident, where there will be hard-forks with quantum resistant algorithms. There will no doubt be multiple coins proposed as the 'new Bitcoin', and there will be a battle for dominance.

Everyone who holds their own keys; their own coins will receive their wallet balance on EVERY hard-fork. Any coins held on an exchange, or if you're in the ETF, those most definitely will not.

So stack sats, self-custody your own coins. It's going to be a wild ride.",16

Surely you do not understand what Bitcoin is, or what it does, or why it was conceived in 2008. I invite you to ask that question to ChatGPT, which will give you a really neat answer. The short version is that Bitcoin is the hardest form of money available, completely different from fiat money. 

It is very fitting that you call Bitcoin a memecoin, while the traditional financial system is the real meme, because money is being printed out of thin air, in staggering amounts. There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoin, so this scarcity is also what gives it it's value. For sure, something only has value because we (as a species) give something value, but in case of Bitcoin it is absolutely based on something.

The founder of Bitcoin said it best: ""If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.""

# I'm curious about what you guys think about the future of SEC regulations under each possible future president.

  
Here are some excerpts from the article:

Donald Trump headlined the [Bitcoin](https://www.disruptionbanking.com/Fintech%20Glossary/bitcoin/) 2024 Conference in Nashville. The main thing that got the crowd jazzed was Trump’s promise to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.

>

Kamala Harris was invited, and her campaign team gave the option serious consideration. There are [rumors](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/07/26/kamala-harris-likely-to-share-bitcoin-stance-in-coming-weeks-industry-optimists-note-her-husband-is-a-crypto-guy/) that her husband is a “*crypto guy*” and that Harris might shift future policy away from the Biden Administration’s aggressive SEC enforcement.

The fact that the Democratic nominee contemplated addressing 30,000 Bitcoiners was itself a huge shift. Biden people would have ruled it out of hand, and it’s a sign that Harris may take a different approach. 

According to the Financial Times, the Harris Campaign wants to “[reset](https://www.ft.com/content/1a4c5066-9cc0-4849-993b-06a28022ad66)” with crypto companies and its representatives have reached out to Coinbase, Circle, and [Ripple](https://www.disruptionbanking.com/Fintech%20Glossary/ripple/) in recent days with the stated goal of building a constructive relationship and creating a smart regulatory framework to foster the growth of the industry.  ",0

1. Tariffs all gone

2. XRP vs SEC case totally cleared - most likely in June XRP APEX in Singapore

3. ISO20022 14 July 2025

4. Full banks implementation of ISO20022 probably in Nov 2025

5. XRPL based Stable Coins adoptions goes up, e.g. RLUSD, XSGD, USDB

6. Market improved after USA recovers from supply chain issues

By end next year….other than China & its Digital Renmibi (e-RMB) there will be many other XRPL based stable coins (3-5 sec) for each country freeing up banks more foreign funds previously reserved for cross border payment under old SWIFT messaging system (3-5days)

Small amount of XRP tokens (finite supply) will be burnt permanently for each XRPL transaction 

Over time XRP can increase in prices once adoption goes higher to improve liquidity per transaction

XRP uses a fraction of the energy required per transaction (compared to Bitcoin) & there will be no more minting of XRP token 

The energy required to mint BTC token exponentially goes up over time causing wastage of energy to produce BTC instead of using on the population.

BTC slow transaction makes it harder to do point of sales payment compared to other crypto 

XRP are well suited for point of sale transactions using crypto wallet apps when banks take over custody of crypto like exchanges after OCC allowed banks to behave like exchanges 

https://www.cointribune.com/en/occ-clears-us-banks-to-buy-sell-and-custody-crypto-with-third-party-support/

|Coin|Points|
|Solana (SOL)|5|
|XRP (XRP)|4|
|Hedera (HBAR)|4|
|Avalanche (AVAX)|3|
|Cardano (ADA)|3|
|Polkadot (DOT)|2|
|VeChain (VET)|2|
|Stellar (XLM)|2|
|Litecoin (LTC)|1|
|Reserve Rights (RSR)|1|

I score each coin 1-5 to guide how much weight I give it over 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, with a “hold-for-ever” status only for any 5-pointer. 

**Solana (5)** leads because its ultra-fast L1 and exploding DeFi scene scream long-term utility, even if the SEC keeps stalling ETF approvals for now. 

**XRP (4)** benefits from Ripple’s fresh settlement, which strips out most regulatory fog; **Hedera (4)** scores equally thanks to its governing council of multinationals, which are already shipping real-world pilots.

 **Avalanche (3)** and **Cardano (3)** have strong tech and engaged dev bases, but their ETF bids are still in limbo, so I’ll keep adding only on dips until the SEC gives clearer signals. 

**Polkadot, VeChain and Stellar (2 each)** tackle specific niches—inter-chain messaging, supply-chain tracking and cross-border payments—but need bigger user numbers before I crank up exposure. 

**Litecoin and Reserve Rights (1 each)** are pure speculative punts: they can run hard in a bull market, but lack moats and regulatory narratives, so I cap them at pocket-change size.

I’ll revisit the list every cycle, yet right now the 5-point bag is locked up for the very long haul. (DYOR, not financial advice.)

I already HODL Bitcoin and Ether as my base layer – they’re the “never sell” tickets in my FIRE plan. The scores below cover everything I’m adding on top of that core stack.",14

Feels like we traded the potential for a quick flip and some Twitter clout. Even the institutions getting in BlackRock, Fidelity, whoever, they’re not here for the tech. They’re here because there’s still money sloshing around. Once that dries up, they’ll bounce too.

It then remained as an avenue to get rich quick, but as it’s matured it’s become more of a way for market makers and KOLs to extract wealth from retail.

Sep 08, 2024

I’ve been saying for months that the action in Bitcoin since March has been a sideways consolidation that will eventually lead to a renewal of the long term bull market and a large rally. Recent action may give cause for reflection on this view.

While it’s too soon to declare the bull case dead, bulls do need to buy the recent dip here to prevent the chart from potentially shifting bearish....

BTC,2024-08-06,post,CryptoMarkets,Crypto Lobbyists Win: Trump headlines Bitcoin 2024 while Harris seeks 'reset',"Donald Trump headlined the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville. The main thing that got the crowd jazzed was Trump’s promise to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.

He concluded his speech with this memorable line, “Have a good time with your Bitcoin and your crypto, and everything else that you’re playing with.”

Kamala Harris was invited, and her campaign team gave the option serious consideration. There are rumors that her husband is a “crypto guy” and that Harris might shift future policy away from the Biden Administration’s aggressive SEC enforcement.

The fact that the Democratic nominee contemplated addressing 30,000 Bitcoiners was itself a huge shift. Biden people would have ruled it out of hand, and it’s a sign that Harris may take a different approach. 

According to the Financial Times, the Harris Campaign wants to “reset” with crypto companies and its representatives have reached out to Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple in recent days with the stated goal of building a constructive relationship and creating a smart regulatory framework to foster the growth of the industry.

BTC,2024-09-02,post,CryptoMarkets,Could Bitcoin Price Volatility Occur During the September FOMC Meeting?,"
Since August 3, Bitcoin has repeatedly failed to close above the $62,000 level and is currently down 11% over the past 30 days. In contrast, the S&P 500 index has risen by 1% and is now just 1% below its all-time high.

This divergence suggests a decoupling between the cryptocurrency market and the stock market.

Impact of Interest Rate Cuts on Risky Markets Investors are anticipating that a 0.50% rate cut by the Federal Reserve could significantly boost risky markets, including Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin's price movements are also influenced by concerns over regulations and actions taken by the U.S. government against the crypto industry.

Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has criticized what he calls ""Operation Choke Point 2.0"" and described Kamala Harris's ""crypto reset"" as a fraud. He pointed to the Federal Reserve's actions against Customers Bank, a crypto-friendly institution, as contributing to weakening investor sentiment.

'Risk Reversal' Strategy to Tackle Volatility To manage potential volatility, professional traders are using an options strategy known as 'risk reversal.' This strategy protects investors from unexpected price movements by buying call options and selling put options.

For example, an investor might buy 3.5 BTC put options at $58,000, sell 3.4 BTC put options at $60,000, and buy 3.8 BTC call options at $65,000, positioning themselves to profit if Bitcoin's price exceeds $65,000 by September 20.

The maximum risk of this strategy is a loss of 0.12 BTC, while the potential profit could reach 0.30 BTC if Bitcoin's price rises by 20% to $70,700.

BTC,2024-08-26,post,CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin Exchange Balance Reaches 3 Million Amid Price Fluctuations,"
Bitcoin investors are maintaining their holdings on exchanges amid market uncertainty. The balance of Bitcoin on exchanges has fluctuated throughout 2024, coinciding with periods of price volatility and asset growth.

Data reveals that the year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin balance on exchanges started around 3 million BTC, slightly increasing to about 3.05 million BTC at the beginning of January, before dropping to 2.93 million BTC in June. However, since then, the balance has risen again to approximately 3.025 million BTC.

Historically, exchange balances have provided insights into market sentiment. From 2012 to 2020, a consistent increase in BTC held on exchanges reflected the growing supply of Bitcoin.

However, since 2020, the trend has become more varied, with periods of accumulation and distribution. The decline in Bitcoin balances over the past three years suggests a more cautious approach to holding Bitcoin on exchanges.

The slowdown in growth and the shift towards self-custody may have contributed to Bitcoin's relatively stable price around the $60,000 mark. This period indicates a potential phase of consolidation as the market digests recent changes. The sentiment seems to have shifted towards Bitcoin moving into self-custody, which is seen as a bullish indicator for the market.
