As XRP breaks above ATHs, this sub will begin to circle jerk each other with “omg we are going to $20/$50/$100”. In reality, the bull market top will be at much lower prices probably around $5-10.

This rally has seen XRP outperforming other cryptocurrencies like BNB and Solana. A potential catalyst for further growth is Ripple's rumored plan to use its escrowed XRP for RLUSD mints, a new dollar-backed stablecoin. This could boost liquidity and reduce XRP's supply, enhancing its utility and price. The stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, could position Ripple to compete with major stablecoins like USDT and USDC.

The losses are attributed to economic uncertainty from Trump's policies, including a global trade war, and Bitcoin's price struggles, which fell below $80,000 at times.

	•	Appointment of a Crypto and AI Czar: Venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks has been appointed to lead the initiative as the crypto and AI czar, reflecting the administration’s commitment to integrating cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence advancements.  ￼
	•	Commitment to U.S. Leadership in Cryptocurrency and AI: President Trump reiterated his dedication to positioning the United States as a global leader in both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors.  ￼

Impact of the Executive Order:

This executive order signifies a significant policy shift towards a more crypto-friendly environment in the United States. By establishing a dedicated working group and appointing a leader for crypto and AI initiatives, the administration aims to foster innovation and provide clearer regulatory guidelines for the industry. The protection of banking services for crypto companies is expected to facilitate growth and stability within the sector. However, the ban on central bank digital currencies indicates a preference for private sector-led digital assets over government-issued ones. Overall, the order is anticipated to bolster the U.S. position in the global digital asset market.",6

XRP,2025-01-17,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: XRP Trading Volume Surges Past Bitcoin on Coinbase...,"tldr; XRP has overtaken Bitcoin as the most traded cryptocurrency on Coinbase, accounting for 25% of its $6.86 billion 24-hour trading volume, compared to Bitcoin's 20%. This shift indicates growing U.S. investor interest. XRP's price has surged over 600% since November 2024, reaching $3.33. The increase in trading volume and price is attributed to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's meeting with President-elect Trump and speculation about a potential XRP ETF approval in the U.S. The number of large XRP holders has also reached a new record, reflecting strong institutional participation.

The surge is supported by increased on-chain activity, with active accounts on the XRP network rising significantly. The bullish momentum is further fueled by Ripple's partnership with Archax and Bitwise's rebranding of its European XRP ETP. XRP's price breakout from a bull flag pattern suggests a potential target between $1.95 and $2.05. However, bearish divergences and low trading volumes indicate a possible market reversal.

Of course he + his cronies made sure to buy XRP + SOL + ADA before this announcement. 

Of course a strategic reserve was meant to be announced when DOGE was doing something illegal or insanely unpopular or if some scandal made Trumps poll numbers tank.   
  
Of course it had to be tactically announced this weekend after that awful Zelenskyy reception at the White House that clearly did not go as planned, making Trump + Vance look completely unable to lead any kind of negotiations into terms of a ceasefire but also calling into question the entire US position as a global leader.   
  
Crypto is not meant to be a meme, a distraction or a scam. But that is what Trump made sure it is with the launch of TrumpCoin. Its a liquidity pool where all of us are the suckers and foreign agents can insert money for Trump to withdraw.

XRP,2024-12-02,post,CryptoCurrency,We need to have a serious talk about Marketcaps. ,"On the XRP sub and other places filled with XRP Maxis, people are saying XRP is going to hit $100 as if it's a very real and very feasible target for the community. Let's talk about what exactly that would look like. XRP has a circulating supply of 57B. At a price of $100 each that would put the marketcap of XRP at $5.7T. OVER 3X the current marketcap of BTC, and this doesn't even consider the inevitable increase in circulating supply as time passes.

Look I get it, it's fun to dream about 25x (or 250x gains for people talking about XRP to $1,000 - I'm dead serious people are talking about this) but don't let those dreams cause you to make bad investment decisions.

\---------

**You want to know what other community was talking about having a $5.9T marketcap in 2021?** In 2021 Shiba Inu to $.01 was all the rage as people swore that it was a realistic and feasible target for the meme token and many made terrible investment decisions as a result swearing that Shiba Inu was going to hit $.01. Looking at Shiba Inu now it's.... not even close to it's 2021 ATH, and lets be clear will never hit $.01.

I don’t care what coin you’re talking about, the “market cap” is only ever total circulation x last price 

It is NOT, and has NEVER BEEN, an accurate measurement of the amount of money in a certain project.  
You simply can’t pull that amount of money out because it never went in. 

However, the xrp ledger can be used to tokenize OTHER ASSETS, and then represent that value as xrp.  
So yes, xrp can easily get to $100 within a few years.  

Market cap is made up. UTILITY is not.  Xrp is the first token that will be valued for its actual use case.  
No other token has been actually used by financial institutions before.  No other token has been desired by BANKS.  What kind of demand scarcity will that create? 

How many xrp tokens are left on exchanges?  It’s not market cap that determines price.  It’s supply versus demand.  And once the demand is there, and no more tokens available, prices will skyrocket. 

No token chart you have EVER seen will prepare you for what xrp is about to do.  Because no other crypto has actually been USED AS INTENDED.  

No one thought Facebook could reach its value.  Same for apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon.  
Do you know what else these companies have in common?  Every single one of them was also sued by the SEC and won their case.

XRP,2025-04-07,post,CryptoCurrency,I think the bull run is over guys,"Bitcoin is at $75000, Ethereum at $1500, Solana is at $95, Doge $0.13, Litecoin $64, XRP at $1.6.

Although I am not selling my leveraged positions, I might get liquidated in the next 2-3 days or a week.

What I learned this bull run is to never buy alts on dips in bull market, it will keep dipping until you are out of cash and/or get liquidated. I will try to buy alts at better prices next time and won't use leverage until I am absolutely certain.

BITCOIN is GOLD

My mistakes were that I invested all my cash into bitcoin sometimes at good prices sometimes at bad prices. And initially on dips I sold my bitcoin to buy alts like solana and doge since they dip more and pump more. Then when I had most of my money in alts and still had no cash to buy the dips I started selling those alts to buy the same alt at 2x or 3x leverage.

I thaught I was very smart and I thought I was gonna 4x my money in months (I first baught bitcoin at 68k more than 1 year ago), even made plans to buy some things but I was actually very dumb. I figured out the best times to buy crypto but I never learned when to sell.

This was my first cycle and I learned a lot.

Most of my money invest was earned through airdrops, so it doesn't affect me as much as it would affect a person who invested his own money to crypto.

Trump fucked us all up.(Mods please don't remove this just because of this line, I will remove  this line from the post if you want) 

Now I am gonna grind in my life and DCA into bitcoin and many alts, and sell at the right time the next cycle.

My solana will get liquidated at 88, bitcoin at 41000 and doge won't. That's all I hold ( I held more solana then I held bitcoin)

I am STUPID",694

XRP,2025-05-12,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: XRP Briefly Overtakes USDT in Market Cap as Daily ...,"tldr; XRP briefly overtook USDT as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, reaching $152 billion due to a 100% surge in daily trading volume. This spike followed the SEC's settlement of the Ripple case but lacked clear macroeconomic reasons, with $61 million in net buying pressure driving the increase. The rise was temporary, as USDT reclaimed its position later. Positive developments, such as potential tax exemptions for digital assets in Missouri, continue to fuel optimism for XRP's future.

Analysts suggest two potential paths: a continued upward move or a notable correction. Using Elliott Wave Theory, CrediBULL Crypto outlines scenarios where XRP could either fall below $1.05, indicating a Wave 2 correction, or hold above it, potentially pushing the price past $2. The recent surge suggests strength, but future movements depend on key support and resistance levels. Currently, XRP trades at $1.46, up 175% in the past 30 days.

As of March 18, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published several recent documents related to XRP: 1. Comprehensive Proposal: XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset for the U.S. (March 12, 2025): This proposal suggests measures to integrate XRP into the U.S. financial system, including mandates for banks to adopt XRP for liquidity solutions and a Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) mandate for XRP usage. The proposal aims to accelerate banking adoption by overriding resistance and allowing banks to use XRP immediately for Nostro account replacement. ￼ 2. NYSE Arca’s Proposal to List and Trade Shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust (February 14, 2025): NYSE Arca filed a proposal to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust, an investment fund aiming to provide investors with exposure to XRP without the complexities of purchasing the asset directly. The Trust holds approximately $16.1 million in assets under management as of January 22, 2025. ￼ 3. Registration Statements for XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Several companies have filed registration statements with the SEC to launch XRP-focused ETFs: • CoinShares XRP ETF: An exchange-traded fund issuing shares representing units of XRP, providing investors with exposure to XRP’s price movements. ￼ • WisdomTree XRP Fund: An ETF that will list on the Cboe BZX Exchange, aiming to offer investors a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to XRP. ￼ • 21Shares Core XRP Trust: An ETF issuing shares that trade on the exchange, designed to track the performance of XRP. ￼",2

XRP,2024-12-11,post,CryptoCurrency,Not a single top 100 Alt from 2021/2022 has hit a new ATH against BTC. ,"An Alt to BTC pair tells how a crypto asset is performing against BTC over a period of time. Perhaps the most famous alt to btc pair is ETH to BTC and although ETH is up in USD it has never hit a new ATH against BTC.

https://preview.redd.it/eyhhd1wf946e1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc377c08596648b802ac69b4ef20f8684f55c87

In fact if you purchased ETH during the ETH to BTC ATH on June 11th 2017 you'd be up \~11X in USD on your investment. But had you bought BTC instead you'd be up over 33x...

https://preview.redd.it/gh4hhi9y946e1.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ceff32260d5b66321b634b363200a89a90a28a1

The fact is almost every single alt will be outperformed by BTC over time and although a few alts may break that trend especially in the short term. Holding alts through multiple cycles is risky at best and foolish at worst.

If we look at the top 100 Alts from 2021, not a single alt from the top 100 in 2021 has managed to break it's 2021 or 2022 ATH against BTC.

* ""Alt season is just getting started this isn't a fair comparison""
* ""Ya But I'm up in USD on my investment""
* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""
* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""
* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""
* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""
* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""

So let's break these down one by one.

**\* ""Alt Season is just getting started""**

BTC Dominance has definitely fallen but if you're gambling on future gains you have to first accept it's a gamble, and the current break down could be the farthest that it goes. If you have gains it's not a bad thing to realize gains.

**\* ""Ya but I'm up in USD on my investment""**

If that's you, you either purchased a long time ago in a bear market and held through a bull market, and a bear market - and you would most likely be up even more if you just purchased BTC. Alternatively you are a new purchaser and you got some nice gains on the breakdown of BTC dominance.

If you held your ALT from 2021 to today you are guaranteed to be down significantly compared to just holding BTC.

**\* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""**

Ya Taxes are complicated but that only matters if you're in profit. If you hold your alt to the top and back down because ""you're a long term holder"", you are simply making bad investment decisions.

**\* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""**

Please STOP with this nonsense, Long term nearly every Crypto asset will not only bleed value against BTC but also bleed value in USD. Don't believe me check the top 100 crypto assets in 2017, 2021, and 2024 and count how many assets from 2017 are still in the top 100 today.

**\* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""**

I'm not trying to get people to sell, I'm trying to get people to stop with the the nonsense where they demonize selling. You can hold your alt of your choice just don't reinforce the mindless selling alts is bad philosophy.

**\* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""**

It's always good to stick to a plan in investments and to think rationally but if your plan is to hold your alt for the next ten years, just buy BTC instead.

**\* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""**

I'm not a BTC Maxi I wouldn't have 98% of my crypto investments in rCC Moons if I was a BTC maxi.

The cryptocurrency, associated with Ripple Labs, saw a 20% increase, reaching $1.49, its highest since May 2021.

The SEC had previously targeted XRP in a lawsuit, claiming it was a security, but a federal judge ruled otherwise. Investors are hopeful that new SEC leadership might drop the lawsuit, boosting XRP's prospects.

The Ripple/XRP ""blockchain"" is broken since the first 32,569 blocks are ""lost"". The company **deleted** all those blocks.

This company has been aggressively promoting CBDC for years, funded media attacks on Bitcoin using money they got by dumping their premined shitcoin, and now they're spending their premined loot in DC to lobby against Bitcoin and pushing for corporate-issued CBDC.

Ripple has no reason to even use a blockchain except to deceive people into a false notion of affinity to Bitcoin.

Sigh,

OK Ill explain this again for those who dont understand the basics of this topic.

https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/consensus-protocol

Firstly Ripple didnt delete any blocks(they're called ledgers btw for the XRPL). The ledgers technically exist and are on chain, we simply dont know the header# to veiw them.  The Meta data of each ledger contains a few things, like the current state of all balances and objects stored in the ledger on all accounts (this is important to remember later)

The other thing each ledger contains is the header which is a unique cryptographic hash created using the previous ledger (n+n^1)  This header is what is used to query/view the data within that ledger.

Unlike BTC, XRP does not use a UTXO data structure.  This means that every single ledger is a complete history of all accounts, transactions, holdings, everything (this is why you see so few full history nodes on the XRPL).  In Bitcoin, if you lose a block, you are fucked because you have to start at the beginning and go forward in time to verify nothing nefarious happened (like the time stack overflow accidentally created 184 Billion BTC and they had to fork the chain in 2010)

XRP does not use UTXO data structure tho, Every ledger instead of requiring the previous to figure out peoples balances/transaction history, is a complete history of everything (remember when I said above this is important to remember)

meaning you can verify there was no ""secret"" or ""corrupt"" or anything nefarious.  You could lose Every single ledger except the last one and the network is fine/can carry on with no problems.  It was literally designed this way to keep its storage requirements light",34

Bitcoin will probably get to $150-$200k, Eth maybe $8k and Xrp $10 and everyone will think this time is different and bitcoin will get to a million Eth $100k and Xrp $100 but if you follow bitcoins 4 year cycle then 2025 will be the year where altcoins will rise people will get greedy and it will crash back down again. People will fomo btc at $150k, Eth at $8k, Xrp at $10 and watch it crash back down to $50k, $2k and $2 respectively when the bear market comes.

XRP,2025-02-07,post,CryptoCurrency,It’s genuinely disappointing how few people care about the actual technology anymore,"Been here since 2016 and everyone used to follow the technology, and you could have great conversations about what technology is the best. Regardless of what subreddit you posted in. People were interested in discussing a chains current upgrades, or open to discussion on what they could work on, and what other chains were leading the way.

Now unfortunately you make any post remotely trying to discuss issues with a chain’s technology, or compare one chain’s technology to another, and that post is going to be obliterated. 

Personally as a software engineer I think Polakdots JAM upgrade is really important for the industry. And I frequently try to get insight into why other people think their chain of choice will have the best technology. 

But literally all you see now is “dead chain”, “look at price”, “look at how fast our transaction are”… like totally fine I get it most people are here for the gains now. But all the subreddits are essentially run by them now, and its impossible to have a solid discussion about the state of the technology

I could be delivering piles of gold under a layer of dust and somehow the arguments and evidence would always be trumped by recent price performance, complaints about marketing, and an irrational fixation on listing on large exchanges (which is very often disastrous to project health and are founder schemes to dump on community - as reported to me by founders not willing to do that).

However, this assertion lacks concrete evidence and is based on speculation.

The price of cryptocurrencies like XRP is determined by market dynamics, not by any single entity. Claims of a pre-determined price by the IMF or BIS should be approached with caution.

Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto suggests a bullish outlook, targeting a breakout to $0.61-$0.62 and a long-term target of $7.50, contingent on maintaining support levels and overcoming regulatory challenges. The market sentiment is 85% bullish, possibly due to recent XRP ETF filings. Technical indicators show oversold conditions, hinting at a possible trend reversal.

XRP,2025-01-20,post,CryptoCurrency,This reeks of major market manipulation ,"I'm in the majority here who believes that the Trump and Melania coins are absolutely ridiculous and are going to have very bad effects on the public perception of crypto, especially ones with real world utility. He has once again grifted his supporters.

It's clear though this is all part of their plan.

There's absolutely no way folks on the Trump team didn't know dropping these two shitcoins back-to-back would not just take folks out of other coins, lowering the price, but also make the entire industry dip.

TRUMP has hit one trillion US dollars in volume since its inception, thus far MELANIA is over 600M in volume., it's clear they knew the timing of each drop to pull a mini-rug on TRUMP and are doing it once again... But where is it going next?

https://preview.redd.it/nuf14v3ck1ee1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdec0b3554e0b4dd1502f1e82de6734c2f02a17

They have clearly shown they can make literally ***anything*** pump, it's doubtful they are done yet with manipulating the market to pump their funds so it's sure they're just padding and maxing their funds before it's pumped at its last stop before the end of the presidency.

Everything has dipped, they're getting anything at a discount at this point if they've already liquidiated their positions from MELANIA so where is its next stop 🤔

Trump has been reported talking with Ripple execs and the Solana team so it's interesting to think of what they have planned to be their real pump, because if they can do this with a shitcoin they have something else cooking up to pad their wallets.

If anyone knows where you can see the volume for any specific coin on a graph please let me know, would love to look into this deeper haha.",569

By the way, The volume is not 1 trillion USD as you are saying right ? I woud assume 39 billion USD is the 24 hours volume, which is already massive, and then the 30 days figure is extrapolated from that. I mean, the Trump coin is brand new since 48 hours so its just impossible.",27

The potential for XRP to reach a high of $3.55 is fueled by hopes for a resolution in the Ripple case and the approval of XRP-spot ETFs. The Senate Banking Committee's upcoming vote on SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw could influence XRP's regulatory future. A Republican-led SEC may prioritize regulation over enforcement, potentially withdrawing its appeal in the Ripple case, which could boost XRP demand and price.

XRP,2024-11-18,post,CryptoCurrency,The way you see Cryptocurrency after multiple bear markets is a lens of everything being a scam,"I got out before Celsius crashed. I also lost almost my entire life savings to Luna. I am still here. I bought Bitcoin at $15k five years ago and held.

I am finally in the green and up thousands. It makes me feel nothing.

I’m pretty sure at this point, a lot of alts are just gonna go into nothing this cycle.
All I’ve learned from crypto is Bitcoin is King and every other crypto are basically scams or a joke that don't have capped supplies.

Bitcoin is limited.  All these other crypto’s are minted constantly equivalent to the US dollar at this point. Why do we as a community stand for that and allow it? Basically from what I'm understanding we as a community are okay with being scammed because of ""freedom"" in crypto, the whole industry is strange to me.

I’m all for AVAX and other crypto that have limited supplies, but I’m done with unlimited minting cryptocurrencies. I get that I have more understanding now of Crypto through the projects that I got screwed by, researched the project I am backing and pulled out of the ones which have minting rates of the millions each year.

Please explain to me how something like DOGE is being considered for the new peoples currency when it is the exact same thing as the US dollar, printed whenever wanted- just on the blockchain. it’s minted whenever they want constantly. just because it has Blockchain technology, that is a buzzword, and it has ELons backing, that's why takes off. It’s more secure to our community but store of value has nothing or no difference to the dollar.

XRP,2025-01-08,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: How high can XRP price go?...,"tldr; XRP has started 2025 positively, rising over 5% to $2.46. Technical analysis suggests further growth, with a bull flag pattern indicating potential for a 72% rally to $4.17. The RSI and 50-day EMA support this bullish outlook. Analyst Mikybull predicts a rise to $3.74, while Peter Brandt speculates a market cap increase to $500 billion, targeting $6.40 per token. Rising open interest, which has historically correlated with price surges, further supports the potential for XRP to reach $4.90 by March. However, investment risks remain, and readers should conduct their own research.

He highlighted the platform’s growth as a key milestone for Ripple, alongside the RLUSD stablecoin and efforts to secure regulatory approval for XRP-based ETFs. The SEC has approved Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, but XRP ETF applications remain pending. Ripple focuses on enterprise blockchain applications, with the XRP Ledger supporting a decentralized exchange and automated market maker.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 34th monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 NOVEMBER Pre Melt-Up Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 7 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **OCTOBER Highlights:** \- Mostly red month. Only **BTC** and **BNB** in positive overall territory. **SOL** getting close to break even. 2022 Top Ten is the worst performing portfolio, by far.
* DCA'ing just once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period **198% vs. 66%** (see below for details)

# Month Thirty-Four – Down -44%

https://preview.redd.it/yc0hgdv3593e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a03fe66252477a65f770d15cd05a40ca444f93

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX.**  

October highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mostly red month, with the exceptions of **BTC** and **SOL**
* **BTC** solidly in first place with **BNB** in second
* Nearly three years into the Experiment, most coins haven’t reached their break even point yet
* The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -44% as a whole.

# October Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranking thirty-four months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/4lxs11eb593e1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=3717d5b8e4e40ca30a6c360091e89916e3523401

With a few notable exceptions, there has been remarkably little movement in rank after nearly three years. 

# October Winners and Losers

***October Winners*** – **BTC** (+10%) and **SOL** (+8%) easily outperformed the field in October.

***October Losers*** – **XRP** (-18%) fell the most this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains lead over BNB.  Only BTC and BNB are in positive territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments.

**BTC** (49%) maintained its lead over second place **BNB** (+12%).  **SOL** is in third place at -2% since January 2022, nearing break even point.

Ever since **LUNC’s** (then known as **LUNA**) [crash in May of 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** thirty-four months ago is worth $0.0001 today – the worst performance of any coin in any of the seven Top Ten Experiments, by far.  It’s hard to remember/believe that **LUNA** was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of 2022, before the crash.

Additionally, at -44%, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/0dqn9l6g593e1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=c425ed5afdc5ac49496a6f63847691f04f59fdd9

Overall, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is down -44%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$555.** 

There hasn’t been a positive overall ROI month yet, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).  

# A note on USDC/UST

In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stablecoin in the Top Ten as I’ve been doing since 2019 and thought I’d showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on stablecoin holdings.  My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then move to more advanced DeFi strategies.  As fate would have it, I decided to showcase the TerraLuna chain converting my USDC to UST and then staking with Anchor.

It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My **UST** is now worth $2.24, down -98%.

It’s a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and we should all continue to be careful. I’m thankful that the lesson only cost me $100:  I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder.

# Total Crypto Market:

The entire market has done much better than my Top Ten portfolio, +6% since January 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/r6pvnv9t593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a31e6afe5d7ca542ec4f01de4065e44815db44

# Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom ended October at 59% and has slowly but steadily been rising since late 2022. Chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/h96cia8v593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ad10273aab33d7ccd4b3adb3ed75efd0c4cb91f

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2022 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +4% (total value $1,043)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +453% (total value $5,532)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +694% (total value $7,944) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +190% (total value $2,901)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -44% (total value $555) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +74% (total value $1,740)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10): up +11% (total value $1,113)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,829**

**That’s up +198%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/vitj36vx593e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=474c35ac8625e2e62a3cb73c3dbe880bd1ac38dd

In summary: ***That’s a +198% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/qc88z4b0693e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1780e68ac96fd418f34e41d7e5b3d353b3e684

The S&P 500 is up +20% since January 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,200 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+198%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/4b4bq4k1693e1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=371c28cbbfe970ee8d70f3d863579d6f9dbccffc

# Conclusion:

As the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto’s volatility (a big if) over the past few years, you’ll find better overall returns in crypto vs. traditional markets – at least at this point in the Experiments.

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  October’s extended report covers the [2022 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), which you are reading now.  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), and  [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) Portfolio reports as well.

I invested at the top of the last bull cycle by big buys in individual cryptos that I determined by hype and feelings. I lost so hard, but was not discouraged. I ended up finally really learning about crypto and which ones I feel strongly about, supported by good market data, blockchain activity, and real world use-case. Then, instead of throwing as much of my extra income as possible into one project, I decided to lower my investment threshold, while increasing buy frequency and spreading the buys across multiple projects. Kept investing as all the doomsayers did their bearish thang. Now I’m up and I’m holding strong. DCA is the way! 

Take profits when you can, obviously. But I am holding strong and very happy to see what else 2025 has to bring!",9

XRP,2025-04-05,post,CryptoCurrency,How is owning XRP different than buying V-Bucks in Fortnite? Both are centralized and controlled by a company.,"Serious question.
XRP is often criticized (or defended) for being a “centralized crypto” because Ripple controls a large share of the supply and influences the network. But doesn’t that make it similar to something like Fortnite V-Bucks? Epic controls them, you can’t use them outside their ecosystem, and they can change the rules or supply at will.

What makes XRP fundamentally different from a digital currency in a gaming ecosystem? Is it just the intent to be used in finance? Or is there a structural or legal difference I’m missing?",362

XRP,2025-04-05,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: How is owning XRP different than buying V-Bucks in...,"For clarity you think the xrpl network is centralised because ripple the company own a lot (but <50% aka a minority)?

The xrpl has a minor (<3%) amount of nodes controlled by ripple on the main node list, specifically just 1. 

Why is xrp popular? Because it’s fast, cheap, scalable and reliable. It has a built in dex and can interact with other cryptos or platforms in the same or greater ways than other cryptos. It’s getting extra layers added to it, specifically smart contracts functionality. 

Fun side note smart contracts were always a potential target but was dropped as a target by ripple to focus their business on just one area. The fun bit: that was at a time when a young vitalik was trying to get a job at ripple (failed for paperwork reasons) and slept on the cto’s couch, sure they didn’t discuss such smart contract ideas and how ripple wasn’t going after such a thing ;) Massive oof in hindsight but here we are. Same as the initial distribution, was it wank looking back? Yes but that is what it is and priced in. 

Also if you wish to talk just speculative investing hopes then both the fact xrp price was nerfed by the sec case in the last bull run and was the highest gainer of the previous 2017/18 bull market then the case being dropped for this bull run might unleash such action again. The heavy usa product focus by the orange man should bode well for the ripple side of xrp adoption. Plus potential etf approval

Historically it was hated by the crypto community in the early days for being the “bankers coin” and working with the man when ripple did choose to focus on a banking product. Wearing suits and trying to improve traditional finance was the opposite of what og cypherpunks were all about. Ironically now even the maxis get hard for that big bank monies. Also ripples image is generally better now as they stood up and fought “the man” when the sec wanted to have their boots licked by all of crypto

This space is noisy and lots of hate when money and competition is involved. Personally i like anything with potential utility and i like many projects, i love xrp but don’t mind if you don’t. Each to their own",24

XRP,2025-04-08,post,CryptoCurrency,I don’t trust XRP and Ripple…,"There are many reasons why people invest in XRP:
• fast transaction speeds
• Low transaction costs
• Their institutional partners

and more...

But after doing a deep dive, there are two massive red flags ive found about XRP.

The first being that Ripple Labs holds the largest share of XRP. About 4.5 billion XRP in their active wallets.

The second being that they have another 38 Billion XRP being released to them in increments of 1 Billion every month in escrow. Remember, XRP has a total cap of 100,000,000,000 tokens. Ripple owns about 4.5 billion XRP in their current wallets and 38 Billion in escrow. Thats 42.5% of the total supply of XRP.

They are very transparent about this themselves as they have posted the following in their latest quarterly report:

""December 31, 2024
Total XRP Held by Ripple: 4,485,366,320
Total XRP Subject to On-Ledger Escrow:
38,030,000,005""

Now, they claim that the XRP they get from these wallets, they sell to fund operations and the rest goes back into escrow. But greed is a hell of a thing. What stops them from not doing that? How do we even know that they are using the sold tokens to actually fund operations?

They answer is we don't. It relies on Trust and not Code.

Now let me ask you this: Do you trust Ripple Labs more than the transparency of code?

I don't and considering the fact that at one point in the future, they may own 42% of the supply just sounds terrible to me. Sounds like a massive risk for centralization.

Honestly, my opinion is that if you enjoy being exit liquidity, then buy XRP.

XRP,2025-04-09,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: I don’t trust XRP and Ripple…...,"First, let’s clear up your numbers…because they’re wrong, and it’s clear you’re trying to shape a narrative without understanding how XRP’s tokenomics and escrow system actually work.

Ripple does not “own” 42.5% of XRP. The 38 billion XRP in escrow is not in their active control…it’s locked and released in monthly 1 billion increments, and any unused XRP goes right back into escrow. 

 This system was intentionally designed for transparency and predictability, and it’s all verifiable on-chain. You know…the “code” you claim to trust.

As for the 4.8 billion XRP Ripple currently holds? That’s public information, fully disclosed in their quarterly markets reports. And unlike certain other projects, Ripple is regulated, scrutinized, and has institutional partnerships with global banks and payment providers..you know, real-world utility.

Your argument about centralization doesn’t hold up either. Ripple can’t arbitrarily dump the escrow or flood the market without destroying the value of their own holdings and partnerships. 

 Not to mention, XRP Ledger is decentralized…Ripple doesn’t control it, and validators are distributed globally.

So calling XRP “exit liquidity” just shows a huge lack of understanding of the technology, the escrow system, and the broader utility of XRP in global finance. 
You’re not making an argument…you’re making noise.

But hey, thanks for the opportunity to correct another poorly researched FUD post.

>The second being that they have another 38 Billion XRP being released to them in increments of 1 Billion every month in escrow. 

which they themselves locked up and have continued to lock up for the last 86 months in a row

which we can see is true because its a public blockchain.

> But greed is a hell of a thing. What stops them from not doing that?

from not doing what? they cant beat the escrow. 

> How do we even know that they are using the sold tokens to actually fund operations?

Because they have admitting to doing so, the SEC papers specifically said this was happening as well, as well as Moneygrams report when they were doing contra expenses for them.

>They answer is we don't. It relies on Trust and not Code.

It specifically relies on code, Again please explain how Ripple is going to bypass their escrow?  Basic game theory, would you destroy the value of ~38 Billion for the value of 1 Billion? they have shareholders, if they attempted to do this by say selling all 1 Billion that gets unlocked, it would destroy their value and cause many shareholder lawsuits.

>Now let me ask you this: Do you trust Ripple Labs more than the transparency of code?

I dont have to trust Ripple labs, I can look at the code and see that they cant beat the escrow. 

>I don't and considering the fact that at one point in the future, they may own 42% of the supply just sounds terrible to me. Sounds like a massive risk for centralization.

Non proof of stake, token ownership is irrelevant.  How much BTC does Satoshi hold? How much ETH does Vitalik/joe lubin hold? How much ADA does  Hoskinson hold? Where are their locked escrow funds? yeah didnt think so",32

Retail is not their target, they also confirmed it even if it's painfully obvious, and their success or failure doesn't depend on us buying or selling.

If it fails, it won't be cause less people bought some.  
If it succeeds, the price should be mostly reflected from usage (one way or another), than from us buying it.

XRP,2025-03-07,post,CryptoCurrency,"The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is established and crypto crashes. Why this bothers me so, and why it feels like manipulation.","
Walk thru this with me: Trump campaigns on a pro-Crypto platform and the SBR.  Bitcoins price moves upwards.

When he’s elected the price shoots to $109,000 on expectations of the SBR miraculously appearing out of thin air. Drops because crypto kids are illogical and impatient.

When he’s inaugurated and signing EOs left and right, it shoots back to $106,000 expecting the SBR early, but drops when it’s not.

Now, when it finally happens, the thing that everyone has been anxiously drooling over is signed into law and, of course…

The price of $BTC just drops off a cliff, dragging the rest of crypto, like $SOL, $XRP and even $DOGE with it. 

WHAT IN THE (and I can’t stress this enough) FUCK!?

Why?

“But it doesn’t spell it out like I’m 5 that they will be buying a million more tomorrow, so it’s an utter epic failure.”

Ignoring, “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin…”

This is either manipulation, or there are some paper-handed, TDS infected, lil’bitches out there who are irrational AF. HFSP",284
XRP,2025-03-07,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is established and c...,"There’s so much more to price action than these news items… tariffs, global liquidity, dollar strength, inflation etc",351
XRP,2025-03-07,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is established and c...,"This reaction makes total sense. The emotional whiplash of hyped expectations versus harsh market reality is exactly what we’ve seen time and time again in crypto.

But let’s take a breath and break this down logically.

First, this is a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” The market is painfully predictable. Big events like this get priced in ahead of time, and when they actually happen, there’s often no immediate bullish catalyst left to keep the momentum going. Traders and institutions take their profits, causing price drops. We’ve seen this happen with Bitcoin halvings, ETF approvals, and now the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Second, the SBR announcement wasn’t actually a buying event. People expected the government to start aggressively acquiring Bitcoin, but the executive order’s language is vague. “Authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies” doesn’t exactly scream “buy now,” so traders panicked and sold. The government isn’t some crypto whale making market moves. It’s slow, bureaucratic, and strategic.

Third, crypto traders are notoriously impatient. This market is dominated by short-term speculators who wanted instant action. When they didn’t get it, they dumped. Retail got spooked, momentum shifted, and the cascade began. It’s not the first time, and it won’t be the last.

Fourth, institutional manipulation is always a factor. Smart money plays dumb money in every market. Big players saw the hype, knew retail was loaded up on leverage, and used this as an opportunity to take profits at the peak. Now they wait for the dip to buy back in while retail panics.

So is this manipulation or just bad trading? It’s both. The market is emotional, irrational, and full of over-leveraged traders chasing momentum. But institutions also know exactly how to play the cycle. They are playing long-term accumulation games, while retail plays get-rich-quick games, and retail usually loses.

What happens next depends on whether the U.S. actually follows through and accumulates Bitcoin in a meaningful way. If they do, that’s long-term structural support for Bitcoin’s price. If they mismanage it or slow-roll the process, the hype could fizzle, and we could see prolonged sideways movement.

This was never going to be an instant moonshot. The market did what it always does—overpriced expectations, sold the news, and punished the impatient. Now the real question is whether the U.S. government is actually serious about accumulating Bitcoin or if this was just another round of political theater.",303

XRP,2025-06-04,post,CryptoCurrency,XRP fakes documents for fake legitimacy,"What are you guys thoughts on this? Apparently Ripple is forging documents to fraudulently fake a cooperation with the European Central Bank. The document is a total fabrication signed by people who do not exist. I feel like this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the questionable marketing tactics that Ripple has been using for the past year. But this time they are basically committing a criminal fraud by forging a document that is supposedly a signed agreement between them and the ECB, and distributing this on all social medias and crypto news outlets. I hope this will open some peoples eyes about the tactics they are using and how far they have been going to pump up their legitimacy. If this would be done on any traditional financial market you would be looking at some jail time for these people.

https://preview.redd.it/a2v80lf2zw4f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7588fb14b3de2fbd892066cf4c46892525f93e37

There is no basis for this document, it is a complete fabrication that is easily verified by a quick search on the ECB website or a google of the supposedly signed representatives.

\* EDIT:

Here are some news that are directly referencing this fraudulent document. And yet, Ripple has not taken any steps to debunk this or correct this, they have had 2 days to do that and have not bothered. ECB has already made a statement claiming this to be incorrect.

\* EDIT 2:

u/JustStoppingBye Just pointed to another instance of fake news from Ripple. Apparently the whole ""Tokenize the oil industry with the Saudis"" was a fabrication as well.

[https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/30/saudi-aramco-not-involved-in-xrp-ledger-oil-tokenization-despite-viral-report-details/](https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/30/saudi-aramco-not-involved-in-xrp-ledger-oil-tokenization-despite-viral-report-details/)



\* Edit 3

  
Another case, the whole ""Ripple is going to buy Circle(USDC)"" was apparently ALSO fabricated, they never even made an offer: [https://www.theblock.co/post/356818/brad-garlinghouse-says-ripple-never-made-a-bid-to-acquire-circle-contradicting-recent-reports](https://www.theblock.co/post/356818/brad-garlinghouse-says-ripple-never-made-a-bid-to-acquire-circle-contradicting-recent-reports)

The fact that these claims are being made by anonymous people in ""the XRP community"" does not dissolve Ripple from any accountability. Even though Brad denied the Circle offer in an interview, Ripple has never denied any of these claims on any of their official channels. And there is no way of proving that there is no connection between their marketing team and the people posting this disinformation, especially when there is no attempt to correct the fraudulent material. ",272
XRP,2025-06-04,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: XRP fakes documents for fake legitimacy...,">The fact that these claims are being made by anonymous people in “the XRP community” does not dissolve Ripple from any accountability. 

Yes, yes it does. Why should they be held accountable for the actions of others outside their organization?

>Even though Brad denied the Circle offer in an interview, Ripple has never denied any of these claims on any of their official channels. 

Brad is the CEO, he is an official channel.

>And there is no way of proving that there is no connection between their marketing team and the people posting this disinformation, especially when there is no attempt to correct the fraudulent material. 

How about you prove there is a connection? You expecting them to ‘correct’ Internet troll posting is odd, they are not about the noise and unless it came from a reputable news source or from Ripple, any ‘news’ or breaking ‘story’ should be treated as suspect.",122

* U.S. stock futures reacted negatively, with Dow futures down 1.2%, S&P 500 futures down 1.9%, and Nasdaq futures down 2.7%.
* The crypto market saw significant declines, with Bitcoin and Ethereum dropping 5% and 10% respectively, and Dogecoin and XRP each falling 19%, leading to over $1 billion in crypto liquidations.
* The tariffs are expected to increase inflation, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates, which could negatively impact borrowing and investor sentiment, particularly in the crypto sector.
* Trading partners have announced retaliatory measures, with Canada imposing matching tariffs and Mexico and China planning countermeasures, contributing to currency fluctuations and market volatility.

This is the market cap chart from 2021. I picked 10 April because it has the same market cap as today:

To reach the same price as back then, ALGO needs to go up by 300%+ to 11.7B marketcap. Holders got dumped on by the ALGO foundation and VCs.

This is the same case with a lot of other VC coins from 2021 like LDO and many others. Which is why people are avoiding the new low-float high-FDV scams this cycle.

People often forget that supply cap does not mean it doesn't mean low or no inflation.

------------

I have 2 theories on why ALGO dropped so much the past cycle. High Inflation was half of it, and the other half is how native ASA tokens make it harder to spread airdrops and scamdrops.

**Due to limitations of ASA native tokens, memecoins and airdrops don't work well on Algorand, and thus Algorand can't expand as virally as networks like Solana that embrace memecoins and pump-and-dump scamcoins.**

Unlike ERC-20 smart contract tokens, ASA tokens are native tokens (like Cardano's native tokens) and have a limited set of features. This gives ASA tokens more security and prevents scam functions, but it also limits their expressivity and feature set. It's much harder to execute a pump-and-dump when the owners of ASA are easy to find, and there are no scam features.

In addition, every user **has to spend an opt-in transaction** for that ASA token and hold a minimum of 0.1 Algo balance per ASA token before it can receive the ASA. This severely limits the viral nature of memecoins and airdrops, which are often sent to random accounts or empty accounts on other networks.",6

I'm not a total crypto skeptic - I still believe the space has long term potential, but I think only a few projects will actually survive the hype cycles and end up being used by people, not just traded.

* Privacy preserving identity systems, allowing verification of criteria without revealing excess information (e.g. prove that you are old enough to buy beer without giving a stranger your DoB, or proving you are a resident who should receive UBI, without sharing your actual address), things like Worldcoin and the Buenos Aires Digital License.",18

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which would be initially funded with assets seized by the government, says the White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks.

“Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” Sacks said in a March 7 X post.

”The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” he added.


Additionally, the order also established a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” which Sacks said consisted of digital assets other than forfeited Bitcoin.

XRP,2025-02-19,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Over $270 Million in Crypto got liquidated in the ...,"**AI interpretation of the headline**

This headline refers to $270 million worth of cryptocurrency trading positions that were forcibly closed by exchanges in a 24-hour period. Liquidation in crypto occurs when traders using borrowed money (leverage) have their positions automatically closed by the exchange because they can't maintain the minimum required collateral.

**Types of Liquidations Involved:**

**Forced Liquidations** happen when the market moves against a trader's position and their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, causing the exchange to automatically close their position to prevent further losses. This protects both the exchange and the broader market from defaults.

**Total Liquidations** are particularly severe cases where traders lose their entire invested capital, and in some cases may even end up with negative balances. The $270 million figure represents the cumulative value of all such positions that were forcibly closed.

This large liquidation amount typically indicates:

* A period of significant market volatility

* Many traders using high leverage were caught on the wrong side of price movements

* A cascade of forced selling that may have further impacted market prices",3

\- Of the 9.9M members here, you'd be lucky of 100k of them cared about the tech. Interest in coins that actually work is non-existent.

\- Because of its privacy focused nature, the coin and its users will always be on the wrong side of the government. Even if you're using it for legal transactions, purely by choosing to use that chain you won't be trusted. This also stops mainstream adoption in its tracks.

\- Nobody actually cares about privacy either, so they see no reason to use it and no reason to support it.

\- It's also very hard to create any hype around because it's difficult to buy. Most exchanges kicked it, so even if you created some nonsense social media hype the overwhelming majority who see it don't know how to buy it.

Company ABC in the US is buying something for $100,000,000 USD from Japan.  In traditional finance, this takes days and is expensive.  Nostro/Vostro, currency exchanges, etc….

XRP is supposed to make this almost instant and cost pennies.

If XRP was the medium for this transaction….How did the $100,00,000 turn into XRP? Who held the XRP, who moved the XRP, where did it get moved to, and who holds it at the end of the transaction?

I am not understanding the “value” of an XRP token when it appears to have an instantaneous use, and then goes into some hiding place?  Can it only be used once?  Is it recyclable?  Who else can use it?  When? How?

Just trying to visualize the value proposition for 1 XRP.

XRP,2025-01-18,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Clear me up….Who holds it? Who uses it?  Where doe...,"It's the same for all projects. The tokens have a market value. That's the point.


You turn $100 mil into its equivalent in tokens, send that (which is fast and cheap), and then it is sold back for $100 mil in another currency.


Someone has ownership of those tokens at all times. You buy it from Person A on an exchange, send to Person B, they sell to Person C on another exchange of their choice.


The token has then moved through three unique wallets during the ownership swaps. Since it is fast, the instantaneous value won't change too much, so that $100 mil is preserved from market crashes more than one that takes 5 to 7 minutes, for example.


This is how all crypto trades work, the only difference is speed, fees, how many buyers there are at any time, etc.


Of course, real world utility would require large amounts of buyers at any time for prices to hold. You can't just move a billion and settle if no one is on the other side to pick up the sale later on. Hence why trading volume, circulating supply, and price matters.",93

You think stablecoins and XRP solve the same problem. they dont, stablecoins enchance XRP's ability to function.

>Why switch from dollars in to some random token, when you can just send tokens pegged to the dollar's value?

Because the cost is higher, the speed is slower, it doesnt scale on that network, there might be less liquidity (which makes all the other problems worse)

If I have Thai bhat and need egytian pound. using XRP is faster,cheaper and more secure than stablecoins.  You can also go across multiple ledgers via ILP with XRP.

XRP,2025-07-13,post,CryptoCurrency,I need to understand.,"At what point does BTC become a rich man’s game and retail gets locked out again?

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately and I’m genuinely confused. Wasn’t Bitcoin originally created to help the average person? 

To be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that bypasses traditional banking gatekeepers?

But here’s what I’m seeing:
	•	Transaction fees that can spike to $20+ during busy periods
	•	Lightning Network requiring technical knowledge most people don’t have
	•	Mining becoming dominated by massive industrial operations
	•	Institutional adoption driving prices to levels where a whole coin costs more than most people’s annual salary
	•	Self-custody requiring technical skills that intimidate regular users

I keep hearing that Bitcoin is “the best monetary system known to man” - and maybe it is from a technical standpoint. But if that’s true, why does it feel like we’re heading toward a system where only wealthy institutions and tech-savvy individuals can actually use it effectively?

The man on the street who Bitcoin was supposedly created for now needs:

	•	Expensive hardware wallets
	•	Deep technical knowledge of seed phrases, private keys, etc.
	•	Ability to navigate complex DeFi protocols
	•	Enough capital to make transaction fees worthwhile

Meanwhile, the same financial institutions that Bitcoin was meant to disrupt are now buying it up by the billions and potentially manipulating the market just like they do with everything else.
Am I missing something here? 

Is there actually a realistic path for regular people to use Bitcoin as intended, or are we just recreating the same exclusionary financial system with extra steps?

Would love to hear from people who’ve been in this space longer than me. Are there solutions I’m not seeing, or is this just the inevitable evolution of any successful monetary system?

TL;DR: Bitcoin feels like it’s becoming exactly what it was created to replace - a financial system that only works for the elite. Change my mind?",41

If you just want to buy things online, there's ETH.

Retail doesn't get locked out. Anyone can buy BTC at any price point, you don't need to buy 1BTC you can buy any amount down to 0.00000001BTC. 

>Wasn’t Bitcoin originally created to help the average person?

No

Yes

Correct. Bitcoin has failed to become digital cash, but the Bitcoin community was comfortable abandoning the original vision in favor of ""digital gold"" because they conveniently didn't have to fix Bitcoin and because they were all so rich.

>I keep hearing that Bitcoin is “the best monetary system known to man” - and maybe it is from a technical standpoint. 

It's not, Bitcoin sucks from that standpoint. Stablecoins on Ethereum are 1 million times better, hence why the popularity of USDT and USDC.

>The man on the street who Bitcoin was supposedly created for...

This is a misconception. People have been trying to create a digital currency without a centralized authority that solved the double spend problem for decades and that's really all Bitcoin was created for. Bitcoin was as much about solving a longstanding technical problem, a puzzle. It was never intended for the masses to bring about some kind of equality beyond having equal access to the network with other peers.

>Is there actually a realistic path for regular people to use Bitcoin as intended, or are we just recreating the same exclusionary financial system with extra steps?

No. BTC will never become a cash alternative and Bitcoin isn't designed to have secure L2s. It's been 15 years and Bitcoin doesn't even have a successful sidechain. It's really more like a financial system with much fewer steps cause Bitcoin doesn't do a lot if we're being honest.

>Would love to hear from people who’ve been in this space longer than me. Are there solutions I’m not seeing, or is this just the inevitable evolution of any successful monetary system?

No solutions coming. The Bitcoin community is very happy where things are going, ""digital gold"" is a huge success so why would they want things to be any different?

>TL;DR: Bitcoin feels like it’s becoming exactly what it was created to replace - a financial system that only works for the elite. Change my mind?

Bitcoin doesn't solve capitalism, but it did solve the issue of creating a digital currency that wasn't controlled by central authorities and wasn't prone to inflation. However, Bitcoin is of course now controlled by a new wealthy elite and it's probably more about being an instrument to make people richer more so than it has to do with any crypto ideals at this point.",8

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Bitcoin prices are unsustainably high after surging 89-fold in a year and that the virtual money isn’t currency.

“It’s a bubble,” Greenspan, 87, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from Washington. “It has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven’t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.”

In the past 24 hours, 220.344 traders were liquidated with a total liquidations in $538.86M... The largest liquidation happened on Binance BTCUSDT with $8.21M liquidation.

From the heatmap we can see that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the lead in total liquidation volume with $112.69M and $106.20M, respectively. However, Others category that represents altcoins is not getting behind surpassing both with a total of $128.82M. Alts proportionally bleeding more than the big two. Other important alts like SOL, DOGE, XRP are also experiencing significant bleedings.

Even thought I expected a rally looks like the market is priced in the incoming events data like US CPI and maybe other bearish future news that at least I am not aware of.

If you believe in crypto in the long term, you will see this as an opportunity to load a bit more in a cheap price before things get again bullish. I think we are currently getting close to the real bull run and it is not a surprise to see this kind of dumps during January.

Let see what future has saved for us, stay safe, trade safe and don't let the noise and FUD blur your goals.

","Hi community.

I hold about 1 BTC and that's it, nothing else. I don't want to go into altcoins, I want to limit my risk to BTC/SOL/ETH for this bullrun.

How would you distribute a three coin portfolio today? Considering that ETH is very cheap in BTC, should I move some over now? How would you decide on the distribution between BTC/SOL/ETH? Since I'm a Raoul Pal disciple, I tend to believe more in Solana, so my thoughts are to go:

1. 50% BTC
2. 35% SOL
3. 15% ETH

XRP,2024-09-25,comment,CryptoCurrency,"Comment on: Daily Crypto Discussion - September 25, 2024 (GMT+...","Hi everyone, I'm new to crypto and looking for advice. I recently bought about $50 of 8 coins (so about $400 total) - BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, UNI, AVAX, AKT, and NEAR. I'm hearing good things are to come this October, and also following the US election. I take it all with a grain of salt but I'd like to try my hand and get some new coins or some more of the coins I have before the start of October. So here's some questions if anyone feels compelled to offer their thoughts:

  
What's the deal with October? Is it just people anticipating the election and buying more, driving up prices?

What are your thoughts on my strategy of buying small amounts of 8 coins? Am I just fucking myself with Coinbase service fees? Should I have put more into BTC?

In this last week of September, what are your recommendations on coins? In particular I'd like to know of any coins that people suspect will rise in the short term. Should I put a little more money into any of the 8 I already have? Realistically, should I just chill the fuck out and not invest any more cause this whole thing is a crapshoot and mostly for fun? I don't have a ton of money to play with and want to be safe with where it goes. 

Thanks in advance for your thoughts. Good luck to you all.",5

With Republicans in control and anticipated changes at the SEC, the crypto industry is hopeful for a fresh start. Garlinghouse emphasizes the need for the U.S. to act decisively to maintain its global edge in cryptocurrency. The new Congress, with members supporting innovation and investor protection, aims to provide clarity through legislation like the FIT21 Act and stablecoin rules.

XRP,2025-06-07,post,CryptoCurrency,Does XRP have a future?,"

I’m in an XRP subreddit, and it’s pure madness it feels like a cult. I genuinely want to understand if XRP has any real potential. It’s practically centralized, with multiple bank partnerships (from what I’ve seen), and there are billions upon billions of XRP in circulation unlike Bitcoin, for example.  

So, is there anything that could actually drive XRP’s value up someday? If so, what? I constantly see positive news around XRP, yet the price drops instead of rising. Sure, there’s heavy market manipulation, and whales keep liquidating small holders, but it’s still weird. It’s as if the market reacts negatively to developments, signaling disapproval of XRP’s direction.  

I know XRP offers fast transactions, low fees, etc., but none of that seems to boost its price. So, what makes it special? Why should (or shouldn’t) I invest in XRP?",4
XRP,2025-06-07,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Does XRP have a future?...,The xrp community cares about XRP more than Ripple lol.,23

XRP,2025-05-05,post,CryptoCurrency,We’re clearly seeing a global crypto wave building up.," Here’s what some countries have recently done to speed up adoption:

1. Pakistan (2025): CZ joins the Digital Assets Council. A big move to regulate and promote crypto in the country.


2. Kyrgyzstan (2025): New Digital Assets Council with CZ + partnership with Binance to modernize crypto payments and educate on decentralized finance.


3. UAE (2024): Ripple gets a license for crypto payments. Dubai is cementing its status as a major crypto hub.


4. Thailand (2024): USDT and USDC are now authorized for trading. Crypto becomes more accessible there.


5. USA (2024): The SEC approved 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Huge turning point for traditional investors.


6. European Union (2024-2025): MiCA regulation kicks in, finally providing a clear framework for crypto across the EU.

7. Bitget (2024): Launched the Bitget Card in partnership with Mastercard, allowing users in Europe to spend crypto directly like fiat across the Mastercard network. 

8. Bhutan (2024): $500 million invested in Bitcoin mining infrastructure. Clear ambitions in the sector.


9. Hong Kong (2024): Exchanges can now offer retail crypto trading, and Bitcoin Spot ETFs are pending approval. HK is pushing hard to become a Web3 leader.

Something is definitely happening here.

Between regulations getting structured (EU, US), new markets opening up (Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan), and hubs like Dubai and Hong Kong accelerating — it feels like this wave is global for real this time.

Is the old ""crypto = wild west"" narrative finally dying?

What do you think? Is this the start of a new bull run driven by states and institutions? Or just normalization without the hype?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the 23th month of the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT,** and **LTC.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 DEC Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the features in this year's (2024) Top Ten Experiment*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/)***.***
* **NOV Highlights:** All green month, **XRP** nabs both the monthly and overall leads, **DOGE** in second.
* The 2023 portfolio is **+248%** since inception vs. +58**%** from the S&P500. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+366% vs S&P500's +75% - see below for details).

# Month Twenty-Three – Up +248%

https://preview.redd.it/ohafcv3rwl8e1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=2031e6668254e82c0533ba908e9e00ffa09e218a

The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC.**

November highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:

* All green month
* **XRP** takes the monthly victory
* **Overall:** From fifth place last month, **XRP** jumps into the overall lead. **DOGE** is in second followed by **BTC.  MATIC/POL** is in last place and the only crypto in negative territory.

# November Rankings

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks twenty-three months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment – 60% of the projects have dropped out of the Top Ten since January 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/mh6as0kuwl8e1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9136d6deda0133b9b91bd3843d7d3f26b6a3771

# November Winners and Losers

***November Winners*** – **XRP** gained a massive +319% this month followed by **ADA** (+222%)

***November Losers*** – At +13% **BNB** was the worst performer of the month

# Overall Update: XRP ahead followed by DOGE in second.  MATIC is in last place.  90% of cryptos in the green. 

**XRP** (+568%) came out of nowhere this month, jumping from fifth to first place, overtaking **DOGE, BNG, ETH,** and **BTC** in the process.  

The initial $100 invested in **XRP** twenty-three months ago is worth $669 today. 

90% of the 2023 Top Ten cryptos are in positive territory this year.  Only **MATIC/POL** (-21%) is in negative territory.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/6l7ra7nxwl8e1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e8ab86231d5c4a1f67996ffaf283f90dd5a8c5b

The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio ended November up +248%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2023 is now worth **$3,483**.

# 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

Last year I ran a friendly competition between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  

**AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  

Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** was an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  At the beginning of 2023, $1,000 USD was worth 17.15 **AMKT.**  

Here was the result of that side Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/0wy9kpzzwl8e1.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1acaee487148925286b0810e4d7a98436123e9

Overall winner: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).**  

In the end, it really wasn’t close – **AMKT** took 9 out of 12 monthly victories and held the overall lead throughout 2023, returning +141% vs. my Top Ten’s 73%.

At the end of 2023, the value of the **AMKT** provided by Alongside for the Experiment was donated to [The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research](https://www.michaeljfox.org/).  Since I’m repeating the friendly competition in 2024, I’ll make another donation soon.

And what if I held that 17.15 AMKT until today?  It would be worth $4,459 vs. the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio’s $3,483.

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2023 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +79% (total value $1,789)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +756% (total value $8,559)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +999% (total value $10,994) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +369% (total value $4,694)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -1% (total value $991) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +248% (total value $3,483)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11): up +110% (total value $2,100)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$32,611**

**That’s up +366%** on the combined portfolio.

For context, the peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/1ekdqbg3xl8e1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=9488ddf26ae1076e238575dc9b8f7e7425fd62a6

In summary: ***That’s a +366% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/rg3pvk46xl8e1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=005c8b82dc8a0e4d9158f0363f0ef79c5d65efe9

The S&P 500 is up +58% so far in 2023, compared to the Top Ten Crypto portfolio’s +248%.  The initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,575 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,262 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,413 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,872 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,610 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,269 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,575 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,268 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $12,269.**

That is up **+75%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+366%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Crypto Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/2u8okusaxl8e1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab05a57a5db843672f3e22c9ea6bff17be82c3e

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  November’s extended report is on the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio, the one you’re reading now.  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), and [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34) reports as well.

XRP,2024-12-09,post,CryptoCurrency,Take a moment to remember all the Alt Shills who told you taking profit in a bull run was a bad idea.,"I'm not telling anyone to take profit now that most alts are down 25-30% from recent peaks. But I am going to take a moment to call out the alt shills who said taking profit in a bull run was bad. 

I previously made a post saying if you have major profit in an alt you should take profit and at least recoup your buy in cost. Although it was mostly well recieved a handful of Alt Shills were calling it bad advice and saying that I was trying to crash the Crypto Markets (as if a random reddit post can nuke a market) but had you taken profit when alts were going crazy and people were talking about $1,000 XRP you'd have money to buy todays dip. Hell if you recouped your initial entry cost you could be letting the zero cost position ride and even opening new cost based positions on the dip. 

Let's be clear people who demonize selling alts are simply providing bad advice, and should be ignored.",165

Enough people were around in 2021 to know better.

Besides, its only a 20% correction when many alts are up anything from 100-700% in the last month alone",26
XRP,2024-12-09,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Take a moment to remember all the Alt Shills who t...,"Here’s the thing. If you believe in something like bitcoin or even a stock like Apple, you believe it will continue to go up in the future. Any dip in a worthwhile project will get eaten up in time and more times than not hit a new ath. Take profits if you really need the money I suppose. But if you don’t, any dip like this current one is irrelevant. There is a reason why most bitcoin wallets “awaken after 10 years of being dormant”. Patience is where the real money comes from.

XRP,2024-11-17,post,CryptoCurrency,No Capital gains tax on US Crypto???,"There is a rumor that Trump has a plan to make capital gains on U.S.-issued cryptocurrencies, currently - XRP, ADA, HBAR and ALGO, tax-free. I guess the idea is to attract crypto companies to the U.S. and get more people using crypto daily.   
My questions are these:   
Is this actually coming from Trump's team or was this spread by supporters?  
If no taxes are collected, how will this actually benefit the U.S. economy?   
Is this only for Federal taxes, what about state taxes?  
Could we see a flood of institutional investments for these coins, or do you think that this is not attractive enough for them?

If trump doesn't even use the CEO of ripple, it's going to drop, and drop fast.  XRP is not the only currency thar is fast with low fees, it's just one that gets the most attention along with stellar.  I won't mention the others since this post isn't about that.

XRP,2024-12-03,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Why are XRP users the best at blowing smoke?...,"As an XRP hodler, you're not fully grasping why XRP is pumping and why 2025 will be so huge for it.

Yes Gary Gensler stepping down is a part of it, but you're missing the context of how badly the current SEC held XRP and Ripple down, XRP missed out on the bullrun in 2021 because of the Ripple lawsuit for crying out loud. XRP's whole use case hinges on pro crypto regulations and governments. Like before we can even consider the possibility that banks or other institutions would ever use it, the US government has to become pro crypto. Trump winning along with at least 250 pro crypto lawmakers signals a massive reversal that's about to happen with the US governments approach on crypto.

This isn't about fucking Brad Garlinghouse getting a spot in the Trump administration, which on its face sounds like a stupid rumor, it's about the people that Trump puts in the SEC to settle the Ripple case and approve XRP ETFs, and it's about a pro crypto congress finally passing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Will XRP ever be adopted by financial institutions? Who knows? Is a pro crypto regulatory regime a step towards that happening? Absolutely.

XRP,2024-12-03,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Why are XRP users the best at blowing smoke?...,"The amount of negative assumptions made by OP suggests he is very but hurt he didn’t buy XRP.

1 - not giant wave of red alone. There are real world utilities to XRP and other tech based chains. Realised or not, it’s true; more than BTC store of value coin. Adoption TBC granted. 

2 - all perceptions of value are dangerous thinking... It’s just a risk/reward gambit. Is there risk with XRP like you stated? Of course; the whole Ripple corporation could go the way of FTX and be found corrupt and tank it. But that’s what educated assessments are and a willingness to wait risk reward. That’s like being a religious believer in BTC, MSTR or AI companies for that matter - all of these are trading at a premium based on future value propositions. 

3 - please mention the others that have a large institutional backing and proven tech system? Stellar has already deployed into both retail and institutional sectors and proven to work over years. Fonbnk in Africa, Felix in Latin America, remittances in Ukraine (who are rolling stellar into their banking systems). Does this imply skyrocketing prices? Maybe / maybe not, but see (2). I implore you to please provide these other examples you touch on but then didn’t supply. 

4 - poster proves his position; he is actually butt hurt he didn’t buy XRP. “Don’t want to Crash the market?” - what a white knight in shinning armour. Where were you in 2008 and 2020
For the equities market. Literally everything humans perceive in value is a mementic, except for companies that own IP or have rights to scare resources. You sound like Schiff; just chill out.

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JANUARY Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years on Reddit for your reading pleasure. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the features in the 2024 Top Ten Experiment*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/)***.***
* **DECEMBER Highlights:** **XRP** takes the monthly victory, followed by **BNB.**
* The 2024 portfolio ended the year **+90%** compared to +**23%** from the S&P500. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+353% vs S&P500's +70% - see below for details).

# Month Twelve – Up +90%

https://preview.redd.it/ip66hd1uz5de1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=662339144504d487d69426528cf91120e40b9b7c

The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT.**

December highlights for the 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Only XRP and BNB end the month in positive territory, the rest in the red.
* Most cryptos in the positive territory YTD except AVAX and last place DOT. XRP flips DOGE for first place overall, XRP is second, BNB in third.
* The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio ends the year +90%.

# December Rankings

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks twelve months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/ypf9wk5tz5de1.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=82bba6cec4a100b3e4fb2e9c089b5f322cb57e7a

With the exception of DOT, most of the Top Ten stayed in place all year.

# December Winners and Losers

December Winner – XRP (+10%) and BNB (+6%) were the only coins in the green, outperforming the field this month

December Loser – a bad month for D-coins: DOGE (-25%) lost a quarter of its value and DOT is down -23%.

# Overall Update: XRP takes the yearly victory followed by second place DOGE.  DOT finishes in last place. 80% of cryptos in the green. 

You didn’t see this prediction much in early 2024: XRP (+275%) was the best performing Top Ten crypto of 2024, followed by second place DOGE (+254%).  The initial $100 invested in XRP twelve months ago is worth $375 today. 

Most Top Ten cryptos finished in positive territory this year with the exceptions of AVAX and DOT.  DOT was the worst performer of this year’s Top Ten Experiment, down -17%.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024:

The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth $1902, +90% this year.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2024 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).  AMKT is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, AMKT is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I tracked this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.23 AMKT.  Here’s the snapshot, one year later: 

https://preview.redd.it/3rlaqyrpz5de1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=61b89692c1f882f7e6a39eee9828e4138b2b640e

December Performances:

* The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio: -9% 
* AMKT: +9%

The monthly victory goes to: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

FINAL TALLY FOR 2024: 

* The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio: current value $1,902 (+90%) 
* AMKT: current value $2,052 (+105%)

Overall winner: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

For the more visual, here’s the table I used to track the friendly Top Ten vs. AMKT competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/k8girkuoz5de1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e84556410fb85492faec54e0f3724f40766804b

That’s a wrap on the 2024 Top Ten vs. AMKT competition.  For the second year in a row, AMKT took the overall lead.  Quick summary:

2023: AMKT returned +141% vs. my Top Ten’s 73%

2024: AMKT returned +105% vs. my Top Ten’s 90%

Not bad for doing nothing.

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2024 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +66% (total value $1,660)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +733% (total value $8,331)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +997% (total value $10,975) (best performing portfolio)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +371% (total value $4,707)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -4% (total value $958) (worst performing portfolio)
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +221% (total value $3,208)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +90% (total value $1,902)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $31,741

https://preview.redd.it/4pfu0cknz5de1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ed8cd2352f14cab965bca7442e1e32bcc6a8c

That’s up +353% on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%.  

The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio remains tantalizingly close to break even point for the first time since its inception in January of 2022 at -4%.

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/vitaw5rmz5de1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=86101edd710d708b91f803c8a11040a9dff2c9b1

In summary: That’s a +353% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/n3395rdlz5de1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=db61fb9db0561c9679c0d913d3c4a0e126b1dbdc

The S&P 500 is up +23% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,233 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,201 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,347 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,821 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,566 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,234 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,532 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,233 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,934.

That is up +70% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +353% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

XRP,2025-03-02,post,CryptoCurrency,Why are there so many haters in here? It’s baffling to me.,"It feels like 80% of people here think anything but BTC is a shit investment. So many people post like ETH is a joke, or XRP, SOL, or ADA are just memes. 

I’m not trying to be a jerk or taking a stab at others, I’m just genuinely baffled. Does all of the potential of the block chain really start and stop with BTC? A cursory understanding of the basics of blockchain pretty much begs to the notion of creative innovation and implementation. 

That being said, the sheer amount of unregulated bullshit that comes out every hour is regrettable. However to suggest every other coin in the top 10 is shit under BTCs shoes is really closed minded IMO. Sure, there is risk, but I think something like XRP, HBAR, or ADA holds a little more credibility then the next “pepdoge420” coin ready to rug pull at a moments notice. 

I would be very interested to hear a genuine response as to why all other crypto except BTC is a scam waiting to happen. However I feel I will just be pelted to death for just simply questioning that point of view here. 

Despite it all, I hope everyone reading this finds good luck and lots of profit in 2025 <3. 



Edit: so far I appreciate there are quite a few good responses here. I think the argument of the pure decentralization of bitcoin vs the various levels centralization of alts is a good one. It’s also people who are rooting for their own bags which makes sense. Also some other good points about the industry in general. 

I appreciate you all. I’ll keep reading more as they flow in.

I'm cynical, too. I just never deluded myself into thinking there was something admirable or noble happening in the crypto space. It's prime territory for grifting and financial schemes. It's an unregulated casino, where the dealers often pick your pockets--and where some ""real"" utility MIGHT emerge from the space after a lot of greater fools are parted from their money.

All that said, I've bought and sold crypto for almost a decade now. I just know that I'm wading through waters filled with sharks.

XRP,2025-03-02,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Why are there so many haters in here? It’s bafflin...,"I get where you’re coming from, but it’s not about being closed-minded, it’s about understanding what makes Bitcoin fundamentally different.

Bitcoin isn’t just ‘another crypto’, it’s the only truly decentralized, neutral, and censorship-resistant monetary asset. No company controls it, no pre-mine, no foundation dumping tokens, no insiders pulling strings. Every other crypto, including the ones you mentioned, has some level of centralization, whether through dev teams, token distributions, or governance structures that can change at will.

It’s not that people think ‘everything but BTC is a scam,’ it’s that history has shown that most altcoins underperform Bitcoin long-term or collapse entirely. Every cycle, people get burned by chasing alts, either losing everything in rug pulls or watching their bags bleed out against Bitcoin over time. Many of them quit crypto altogether. The ones who stick around **eventually become Bitcoin maxis by default** because they’ve seen this play out too many times.

This creates the disparity you see now. The majority of those still pushing altcoins are **newcomers, bagholders hoping for a recovery, or swing traders looking for exit liquidity**. Meanwhile, people who have been here for multiple cycles understand that Bitcoin is the only asset that has consistently proven itself.",38

XRP,2025-03-31,post,CryptoCurrency,This got me removed from the XRP Subreddit: XRP Existential Rant,"Please correct me if I’m misunderstanding Ripple and XRP entirely, but isn’t the goal here to be a super Venmo? Instantaneous, near-free transactions that bridge between currencies?

If so, what the hell is stopping ripple from making their own Venmo-clone app that using their own dang network? Why are we sitting with our thumbs in our asses waiting for a random ass country or financial firm or company to save us?

If the XRP network is soooo good, people WILL USE IT every day. That’s basic capitalism. It’s that easy. Why isn’t ripple making this?


Cryptocurrency in general talks constantly about their use cases but doesn’t provide the infrastructure or software to make it effective, like XYO being a location based crypto with no location locating hardware, swiftcoin trying to be the XRP of crypto but can’t get off their own asses, it just blows my mind.

For the record I know I am painfully underestimating how much work it takes to get these projects up, but if anyone can do it, it should be Ripple, especially with Trump on their side.

I don’t doubt crypto, but it’s hard to defend it from people accusing them of being scam artists when nothing but external factors seem to help it. When was the last time ripple has some something for US? The investors, the consumers? As far as I know, Trump saving us from the SEC and financial firms finally trusting it enough to make ETFs is the only good news. Why isn’t ripple making their use case real themselves? Whats stopping them?

We’re sitting just above 57% so hopefully it can hit 60% within the next two weeks. We can get it over with and let the bear have his one win for the cycle. 

I’m contemplating buying alts, however it depends on what the fed does. If they cuts 50 bps, I think the market will rally. 25 bps will have investors concerned that they’re still behind and we might see a sell off. You also have the “buy the rumor, sell the news” people who might sell at the first rate cut no matter what. 

Buying alts now could be premature, but taking a tiny nibble if you’re a rational degen has some merit imo.",5
XRP,2025-07-02,post,CryptoCurrency,Did you own any Raiblocks/Nano in 2017 - what made you buy it? and what made you sell?,"Did you own any Raiblocks/Nano in 2017 - what made you buy it? 

I remember I first got interested in crypto in 2017, because i had seen bitcoin go up in price earlier and a lot of friends were talking about it, so I also wanted to try to earn money by buying bitcoin. 

Regitering on exchanges were really difficult, when i started since there was so many people trying to sign up that it took multiple weeks for KYC to finish. I then registered on localbitcoin and bought via them. I remember transfering my first bitcoin out of localbitcoin was a really scary experience as i had to make sure i pasted the correct btc adresse, i remember it was really expensive to transfer bitcoin then, i spent around $50 in fees to transfer to my wallet and it took around and hour until i saw the transaction had been recived. 

After having has some experience sending bitcoin around, i did more research about the technology and its purpose. The more i learned about bitcoin and its idea the more i become interested in decentralized digital cash. I liked the idea of having a currency that was not controlled by a central government that basically controls society with their ability to print money and bail themselves out whenever they fuck up.

This is when I started looking into other cryptocurrencies, like Stellar, Vechain, XRP and Raiblocks. First i looked at XRP and apparently it was very fast and cheap to send, but I did not like coin distribution and many said it was centralized, it basically seemed like banking 2.0.

In the the crypto I liked the most was Nano due to multiple factors and the biggest one was probably the initial distribution. 5% of supply was allocated to the dev fund while the rest was given away via google captchas, this way everyone with internet access could participate in the distribution, no need for expensive mining equipment. The idea of having a fully distributed supply was something i found really compelling, similar to how people in bitcoin is exited for yeah 2140 when bitcoin is fully distributed, but with Nano the supply was already fully distributed and there was no need to wait. 

I found Nano really unqiue in the crypo space since it was the only crypto that had fully distributed supply and was feeless. The Nano devs believed they were able to secure the network without rewarding node operators, the idea was to create a network as efficient as possible to make the cost of running a node an insignificant expense. With Nodes being so cheap to run it allows for more decentralization since most people can afford to run one.

I also liked the idea that everyone that owned some Nano, no matter how little is able to participate in the consensus by choosing their own representative. This way if 10 million people own 1 Nano each, they will be strong together if they all delegate their voting weight to the same node. The total supply is 133 million, so those 10 million people would have 7.7% of the voting weight to delegate to whoever they want.

What i really liked about Nano was its simplicity, its supposed to be a pure currency, nothing more, and i think this is its biggest strengths.

I still sell some Nano here and there, mostly when buy services.

I wanted to prepare myself the next bull-run, the one we are seeing now, so i did all the boring work, and learned how to come out on top.

Obviously I have made bad moves in the span of 2022-2024. But if I had followed these principles from the beginning and more strictly, I don't think i would have made most of those mistakes.

# 0. Most Important: Find an Actual Strategy and Stick to It

This is the foundation of any successful investment journey. Don’t let emotions like fear or greed drive your decisions—these can lead to impulsive moves that often result in losses. Whether you choose dollar-cost averaging (DCA), technical analysis, or another method, the key is consistency. From my experience, sticking to a well-thought-out strategy helps you stay disciplined and avoid costly mistakes 9 out of 10 times.

# 1. Bitcoin Dominance Chart

Understanding Bitcoin dominance—the percentage of the total crypto market that Bitcoin represents—is crucial. By analyzing its cycles, you can see how shifts in Bitcoin’s dominance impact the broader market.

For example, when Bitcoin dominance rises, it might indicate that investors are favoring Bitcoin over altcoins (this typically happens during the bear market, and reverses during the bull market), signaling a more conservative market sentiment. Keeping an eye on these trends helps you make informed decisions about where to allocate your investments.

# 2. ETH/BTC Chart

The ETH/BTC chart is a key tool for understanding the current market dynamics and potential future movements. It shows the relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin, helping you gauge whether Ethereum is strengthening against Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is maintaining its lead. Additionally, looking at other pairs like ADA/BTC can provide further insights. Understanding these relationships helps you spot opportunities and manage risks more effectively.

# 3. Risk-Adjusted Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Risk-Adjusted Dollar-Cost Averaging is a dynamic investment strategy that uses a risk index (e.g., 1-100) to guide buying and selling decisions at specific intervals. When risk is low (e.g., a score of 10), you invest a large amount, gradually decreasing the investment size as the risk increases (e.g., at 20, 30, and 40). Beyond a certain threshold (e.g., 40), you pause buying entirely and start taking profits as the risk level rises. For instance, you might sell 10% of your portfolio at 60, 20% at 70, 30% at 80, and the remaining 40% at 90. This systematic approach maximizes opportunities at low risk while securing profits as risk intensifies, leveraging data-driven insights to eliminate emotional decision-making.

I'm not gonna suggest a specific index, but you can find a few online. (The one i use puts BTC at 63 risk right now)

# 4. Bitcoin is King

Bitcoin remains the most dominant and stable cryptocurrency in the market. Historically, very few altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin on a multi-year basis. When the market’s euphoria settles and volatility decreases, Bitcoin often stands out as the leading asset. Keeping a significant portion of your portfolio in Bitcoin (especially during a bear market) can provide stability and act as a solid foundation for your investment strategy, ensuring you have a reliable asset during turbulent times.

# 5. Value Your Portfolio in BTC, Not USD

It’s important to assess the value of your portfolio in Bitcoin rather than just in USD. Even if your portfolio’s dollar value increases, it might still be losing ground compared to Bitcoin. This indicates that while you may see nominal gains, you could be taking on higher risk for lower real returns. Valuing your portfolio in BTC gives you a clearer picture of your actual growth and risk exposure, helping you make more informed decisions about your investment strategy. - It's cool that your altcoin made a 70% year-to-date ROI, but BTC made 136% so far on less risk

# 6. Be Cautious of ""This Coin Will 500X"" Claims

Avoid blindly trusting promotional claims from YouTube influencers or following trends that have already experienced significant price increases. Investing in a coin that has already surged means you might have missed out on the most substantial gains. Instead, focus on researching the fundamental values and long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This approach helps you make more rational investment decisions based on merit rather than hype, reducing the likelihood of falling for pump-and-dump schemes or overvalued assets.",260

The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT.**

October highlights for the 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mixed month, with **Doge** leading the way
* **BNB** continues to enjoy a large lead. **Doge** flips **BTC** and fourth place **SOL**. 
* The S&P 500 is +20% YTD, nearly doubling the ROI of 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio (although the seven combined Top Ten crypto portfolios are outperforming the S&P significantly)

# October Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks ten months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bs27ve8bho0e1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=f71af710dbaf2b066a0ffe53a327457100f3d63b

Other than **DOT**’s significant fall, not a ton of movement in the Top Ten in 2024.

# October Winners and Losers

October Winners – **DOGE** (+38%) outperformed its peers by far this month.

October Losers – **XRP** (-18%), **AVAX** (-12%) and **DOT** (-12%) struggled in October.  

# Overall Update: BNB in the lead, DOGE flips BTC for second place.  60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+82%) remains in the overall lead, but second place **DOGE** (+74%) and third place **BTC** (+56%) made up a ton of ground this month.

Ten months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -54% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** ten months ago is worth $182 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

https://preview.redd.it/i19bdd6eho0e1.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8ab02c448291316fe4f6ef5a1694af2cd9b5d6a

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $33 in October.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth $1,113, right around where we were in [June](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6/).  

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/xffauswfho0e1.png?width=190&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8dfb318b3a7cc089420fab412b4b8cd7f107080

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets. Much has changed over the last 7 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of **AMKT** instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 **AMKT.**  Ten  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot as of 1 November 2024: 

https://preview.redd.it/20b6tv4iho0e1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e53b6e2d309ced6db75b380cc90d925748a951d

**October Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+3% 
* **AMKT**: +6%

The October monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+11%
*  **AMKT:** \+41%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’m using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/zl1bflifio0e1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee369a1f8fec3f267bed4e6e111b43cb183c1a18

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +4% (total value $1,043)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +453% (total value $5,532)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +694% (total value $7,944) (best performing portfolio)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +190% (total value $2,901)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -44% (total value $555) (worst performing portfolio)
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +74% (total value $1,740)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10): up +11% (total value $1,113)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $$20,829

That’s up +198% on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/tsj3aldkio0e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ef442a251b82205814ff8cf79f01e8deb05519

In summary: That’s a +198% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/x99wr9vmio0e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=633b5e46912849704f8bd462adf6cdf0c13e7167

The S&P 500 is up +20% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,201 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.

That is up +66% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +198% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  October’s extended report is on the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.",422

XRP,2025-05-08,post,CryptoCurrency,Ripple lobbyist caused immense seething at the White House,"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/ballard-trump-wiles-lobbyist-00333953

>On a Sunday morning in early March, President Donald Trump greenlit a Truth Social post promoting a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Hours later, he felt like he’d been played.

>That weekend at Mar-a-Lago, an employee of the lobby shop run by Brian Ballard who was attending a donor event at the resort, had personally buttonholed the president and encouraged him multiple times to tout his desire to promote the industry. She even gave him a copy of a message she thought he should write.

>It was only after he posted that missive that Trump realized a company behind one of the tokens named in the post, Ripple Labs, was a Ballard client. He was furious and felt like he’d been used, according to two people familiar with the incident who were granted anonymity to speak candidly.

>“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” the president told associates at the White House that month, the people said, referring to Ballard.

>Ballard has been persona non grata in the West Wing ever since.

. . .

>“He’d been brushing her off — then she kept bothering him and then he finally just gave it to a staffer to put out,” said one of the people familiar with what happened.

>Within minutes of the president’s posting, a furious David Sacks — the White House “crypto czar” — called Wiles to complain, according to three people familiar with what occurred. The White House was hosting a crypto summit in Washington the following week, and it looked bad that the president was singling out some companies for praise but not others.

>Wiles, who hadn’t been with the president that morning, started working the phones trying to find out what happened. Soon White House officials realized that one of the clients in the Truth Social post was Ballard’s — and that the tweet hadn’t even mentioned Trump’s own budding crypto company.

>Trump would later follow up on the message in a second Truth Social post, adding the names of other crypto companies. But by then, it was too late — and Trump was furious.

>Trump’s aides were incensed, too, accusing Ballard of assigning his employee to get Trump to hawk his client. One of them, a top aide to the president, called and yelled at Ballard.",130

# August Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eight months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/mcaxyv3my5od1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=da26b8f86fd4dde37c87e3568c5e4678c117f3c8

# August Winners and Losers

***August Winners*** – No winners this month, although **XRP** (-6%) lost the least ground in August.

***August Losers*** – **ETH, DOT,** and **SOL** fell the most this month, dropping -23%, -22%, and -21% respectively.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, BTC in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+61%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **BTC** (+28%). **SOL** (+16%) is third.

Eight months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -53% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** eight months ago is worth $161 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $156 in August.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$946.**  For the second time this year, the Top Ten Portfolio has ended a month below the break even point.

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/iszaq0tqy5od1.png?width=187&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1735863b0ea81a2609df6809c57a7108372a332

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a

**August Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14% 
* **AMKT**: -18%.

The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5%
*  **AMKT:** +7%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94

The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/wb9vc2a4z5od1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=8086a62642ba07b5504e3c8d71e34a62d8fd8b8e

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  August’s extended report is on the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.

# November Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eleven months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/3thsg8cww76e1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=36233f901c12211a3a4d3a1d3f364493f49643cb

For such a busy year in crypto, not a ton of movement in the Top Ten in 2024.

# November Winners and Losers

***November Winners*** – **XRP** (+319%) outperformed its peers by far this month followed by **ADA** (+222%) and **DOGE** (+172%)

***November Losers*** – Although up +13%, **BNB** gained the least this month.

# Overall Update: DOGE flips BNB for first place.  100% of cryptos in positive territory.  AVAX in last place.

What a difference a month makes: 100% of the Top Ten are in positive territory now, up from just [60% in the green in October.](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10)

Over the last few months, **DOGE** (+375% YTD) has been on a tear, moving from third to first since September.  **XRP**’s strong November landed it in second place (+241%) followed distantly third place **BTC** (+117%).

Eleven months into the 2024 Experiment **AVAX** is now in last place, up +6% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **DOGE** eleven months ago is worth $475 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $987 in November.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$2,100**, an All Time High for the Portfolio. 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

**November Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: +89% 
* **AMKT**: +34%

The November monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+110%
*  **AMKT:** \+88%

Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

A very interesting month for indexooors.  Experiment followers may notice that this is the first month in two years that the **Top Ten Portfolio** has taken the overall lead from **AMKT** and the first month the Top Ten has held both the monthly and the overall victory columns. 

This is undoubtedly because of the outsized gainz of both **ADA** and **XRP** in November which are each purchased at an even distribution model (10% each) in my Experiment vs. the market cap weighted approach of **AMKT**.  As much as I’d like to flex, I predict my outperformance will be short lived, given the data from the last two years and the fact that **AMKT** is coming up on its quarterly rebalancing soon.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’m using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +79% (total value $1,789)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +756% (total value $8,559)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +999% (total value $10,994) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +369% (total value $4,694)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -1% (total value $991) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +248% (total value $3,483)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11): up +110% (total value $2,100)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$32,611**

**That’s up +366%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Special shout out to the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio, which is tantalizingly close to break even point for the first time since its inception in January of 2022.

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/wiazfe93x76e1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f358e22ca6aade166a8c72d671d7361149c021

In summary: ***That’s a +366% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/6rn1l284x76e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dd2b7d65fa6cf1b1eb56ab023810427143228a

The S&P 500 is up +27% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,268 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,262 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,413 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,872 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,610 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,269 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,575 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,268 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $12,269.**

That is up **+75%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+366%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

XRP,2025-07-11,post,CryptoCurrency,Altcoin Rally and Altseason Signals,"[Chart showing BTC\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/dt68cslma5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd87a01908addf934ee0739d749c95a788ab8ea5)

As Bitcoin breaks its all-time high again and Ethereum begins to show meaningful rebound trends, the market's focus naturally shifts to the anticipation of whether the altcoin market will now catch fire. However, one must remember that the market's structure operates in contexts beyond mere price rises. The phenomenon known as altseason is not defined by a few specific coins rising; the key lies in how funds flow and how market participants interpret that flow. The current phase seems closer to a period of checking the potential for a shift in capital rotation rather than a short-term rally.

  

# Understanding Bitcoin Dominance as an Altcoin Rally Signal

 

[Chart showing Bitcoin Dominace](https://preview.redd.it/aazyf58qa5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb779ebd45319266c2e76f8bc3231b05e3e06b7)

 

The first criterion for judging market structure is Bitcoin dominance. This indicator distinguishes whether liquidity entering the market is staying solely in Bitcoin or gradually moving to Ethereum and altcoins. A true altseason occurs when funds progressively flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum and then to mid- and small-cap altcoins.

If Bitcoin's dominance forms a peak and turns downward, it can be interpreted as a signal that funds seeking higher returns are starting to move to other sectors. Recently, despite Bitcoin's new highs, dominance has been stagnating or slightly declining, which appears to be a turning point worth watching closely. If this trend persists, it's hard to ignore the possibility that the market's balance is tilting toward altcoins.

 

# The Role of ETH/BTC Ratio in Altseason Signals

 

[Chart showing ETH\/BTC](https://preview.redd.it/y854kmzva5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=338d35e096bce3d26ee605999cef06bf53db2ade)

 

In the same vein, the ETH/BTC ratio plays a crucial role. The real starting point of altseason has always coincided with the rise of this ratio. When Ethereum begins to show strength against Bitcoin, the market accepts it as a signal of structural recovery. This is not just because of its position as the second-largest by market cap, but because Ethereum serves as a central hub connecting DeFi, L2, NFT, and infrastructure ecosystems. Ethereum's strength implies more than just price; it suggests the recovery of demand across the entire alt market.

If the ETH/BTC ratio consolidates at the bottom and continues its rebound, it could be seen as a clear 'first confirmation signal,' providing investors with reason to reassess their altcoin portfolios.

 

# Broader Market Factors Influencing Altcoin Rallies

That said, it's still too early to draw firm conclusions. While funds concentrating in some thematic altcoins are detectable, it's hard to view this as spreading to the entire market. For instance, the recent rises in tokens related to AI, RWA, and DePIN are closer to localized rallies driven by specific narratives rather than a broad alt market uptrend. For an environment worthy of being called altseason to form, widespread concurrent rises must appear across Ethereum-based projects, neglected mid- and small-cap chains, various L1 and L2 ecosystems, and thematic DeFi and NFT projects. Particularly, without accompanying recovery in trading volume and on-chain metrics, the market is unlikely to sustain on short-term expectations alone—a critical perspective is needed here. These indicators serve as keys to gauging market health, steering away from fixation on mere price fluctuations.

Moreover, altseason has always emerged in market cycles after Bitcoin's stable rally. In phases where Bitcoin repeats sharp ups and downs, funds seek stability, which acts as poison to the alt market. Conversely, when BTC stabilizes at a certain high or enters a sideways phase, market participants then turn to risk assets for greater returns, and that's when the altcoin market starts to stir. **The current situation being merely the 'initial stage of fund movement' suggests that excessive optimism should be guarded against.**

 

# External Economic Triggers Like US Rate Cuts

 

[Fed Rate Cut Probabilities from CME FedWatch Tool: Essential Signals for Anticipating Altcoin Rally in H2 2025](https://preview.redd.it/vzyaq610b5cf1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddfe4135c1da0757d53483a0dd29cf7f5e82521)

 

If expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, signs of liquidity re-expansion, and tech stock-led stock market rises align, a full-fledged risk-on flow could form in the cryptocurrency market as well. In such a case, funds are likely to flow sequentially beyond Bitcoin to ETH and the entire altcoin market. **Especially, with institutional funds accessing the market through various channels like stablecoins and BlackRock ETFs, the current flow creates an environment where altseason can be designed on a foundation entirely different from the past**. While these external factors can promote structural changes in the market, considering that their effects may not be immediate calls for flexibility in investment strategies.

Bitcoin's current movements are not significant on the surface. Amid fluctuations of around 2%, it even shows patterns of digesting selling volume in a box range retest phase. Observing whether small buys are gradually entering in this range or if selling resumes at resistance levels is more important. Real bull markets often create vertical rises without giving time to buy. If the market is giving time for many to ponder support and resistance and worry about corrections, it also means it's still early. In other words, it's not too late. Rather, if meaningful corrections emerge in this process, that point could become a buying opportunity. Strategies focusing on accumulating spot positions in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple remain valid. Full-fledged rallies usually start not after people's convictions form, but while doubts linger.

While Bitcoin shows volatility of 1-3% per day, opportunities are more frequently observed on the altcoin side. Especially since the overall market hasn't entered an overheated phase on a spot basis, strategies to accumulate positions in such phases may be reasonable. More important than short-term fluctuations is where funds are residing and in which direction they are moving. This could be the starting point of that transition.

 

[Chart of the Altcoin Season Index](https://preview.redd.it/76b8u665b5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=75411e89903e8db99b9a9453cd790560bf48084b)

 

Of course, the futures market now offers environments for significant profits. But looking back at past flows, in phases where bull markets fully materialize, investors maintaining consistent spot portfolios often recorded higher returns. Short-term trading is a means to maximize momentary profits, but when the market starts riding a structural uptrend, long-term holding strategies can work more advantageously. This is even more so in phases where market vitality is reviving like now.

Particularly, fixating on daily charts, immersing in daily market updates on cafes or communities, or relying on overly amplified macroeconomic analyses to time buys often leads to getting caught in FOMO psychology. But the market doesn't wait for such interpretations or predictions. Directions don't change immediately just because rates rise slightly or inflation stabilizes somewhat, and in fact, Bitcoin has broken new highs amid such debates. This approach may seem analytical on the surface, but in reality, it tends to lead to fixation on instant profits, pushing oneself into increasingly unstable states. Above all, even when the market starts to grasp a full direction at crucial points, most are not prepared to ride that flow.

A single trading mistake can damage an account, or conversely, missing one opportunity can leave one watching the entire bull market from the sidelines. Given that the current market environment favors structural and long-term strategies more, taking such risks seems unwarranted. Reflecting back, investors who consistently held spot or some futures from April onward would now be in sufficient profit zones. The likelihood is high that this yielded far better results than repeated frantic trading daily. Ultimately, attempts to time the market often lead to frequent failures, **whereas those riding structural uptrends gain the effects of compounding through time and direction. Approaches that are not sustainable or recoverable can become causes for pushing oneself out of the market even in bull phases.**

 

[Psychology of a Market Cycle: Key Emotional Signals for Predicting Altcoin Rallies and Altseason in H2 2025](https://preview.redd.it/2cfqo558b5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e518911688f2ffcd77d2bde609617fb11a8f60)

 

For some, this phase may be a time to prepare for new opportunities, while for others, it could be interpreted as a section to trim positions or reduce risks. But what's important is clearly establishing one's strategy and building a portfolio accordingly. While it's not yet possible to assert what flow's starting point this is, it seems sufficient timing as preparation to close out the fourth quarter of this year with meaningful profits. Approach it with a strategic perspective, without being too hasty but without missing the flow.

XRP,2024-12-13,post,CryptoCurrency,Is this cycle different? ,"We hear it time and time again, this cycle is going to be different, there won’t be a crash, HODL.

I’ve been in this space since mid 2017. I really thought I had to buy as much as I could because it’ll be too late to buy it later. For a poor college student I made crazy gains and never sold. By 2020 I almost forgot about crypto but I still had my bags and sure enough by 2021 I had unimaginable gains. 

Greed got the better of me again, I wanted to sell but didn’t have strategy and thought I could time the top. Illogical fear of being taxed on every trade also held me back. I could’ve sold and made a profit, I could’ve sold and bought other coins and made profit in profit. But the fear of selling and already creating a taxable event and then risking that profit on other trades (more greed) that could lose it all and leave me with a tax burden made me do nothing. 

Again in 2021 the narrative that I had to stay in market because these prices would never be seen again started getting the better of me. I, like many influencers and comments I’ve seen this last year, vowed that I wouldn’t believe that crypto is dead after the 2021 cycles ended, and more importantly I will take profits in this current bullrun. 

My confidence is wavering again and here’s what’s different.

We’ve realized the 2017 dream of crypto becoming mainstream. We have Bitcoin ETFs, we have ripple kicking the SECs ass for all of crypto, we have shareholders pushing FAANGs to hold a portion of their assets in Bitcoin, a Bitcoin national reserve for crying out loud. 

What’s different is this run is happening during a recession, an economic shit show. A lot of people thought we wouldn’t have a bullrun again because the economy is so bad, but here we are. Sure it’s reflective of how much value the dollar has lost and all that finance stuff.

Technically based on history and halving cycles this is early in the bullrun. But I am seeing so many posts about people needing to sell to get out of debt. I am seeing so many people planing around cashing out this time and the conspiracy part of my brain is yelling they would do this. They (blackrock, jp, government, big dollars) would wait to do it this way. They would wait for retail to be most vulnerable to really make this mainstream. This makes me uneasy. 

I will take profits this time. Yet again I fear that they will make the best cryptos unattainably expensive moving forward. They will let us take our measly profits now that they know we need the money to pay for out cost of living/debt before they go all in and remove our ability from getting in at a time to make crazy gains. 

TLDR; I need to sell for profits but feel like adoption is moving so fast now that the opportunity to get in this early won’t come around again. Nothing new but definitely with better reason now with how much it’s being adopted now. ",39

XRP,2024-12-14,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Is this cycle different? ...,"Yikes. Time for school.

Adoption is still less than 10% worldwide.

Crypto is still moving as fast to adoption as the internet. 

The 4 year bitcoin cycle ALSO correlates to a 4 year worldwide moneyflow cycle.

So, although we are moving towards mainstrain adoption, we are not there yet. When blockchain technology is the backbone of every financial transaction and real world assets are digitized, then we'll know we've arrived.

So don't be fooled, this bull run will run through the fall/early winter of 2025 and everyone needs to have their exit strategy ready so they can buy the bottom in 2027.

Don't be fooled.",67

They cashed out 1 million to 2 million USD, not bad right ?

Are they regretting this harshly these days when these 1000 BTC could have been 100 million USD instead of 1 or 2 million. They most probably do.

Take the profits if you need to, and if you want to better your life in a way that is really meaningful to you that you cannot regret. Do NOT take the profit to time the market, or to trade up. Thats a sure way to end up with less BTC.  That is the lesson imo.",12

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the FIRST month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 FEB Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **JAN Highlights:** Mixed month, but overall up.  **XRP** nabs the monthly lead followed by **SOL**.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+323% vs S&P500's +766% - see below for details).

# Month One – Up +7%

https://preview.redd.it/trx8sjru1bje1.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcfb2b9a3a84d8b1c7bb96218ff95a1873cf86e5

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

January highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **SOL** lead the way
* Mixed month, but gains outpace losses 

# January Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bzr1catv1bje1.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634081a2542903b9d2017dd280b0afdae59a6e9

# January Winners and Losers

***January Winners*** – **XRP** (+38%) easily took the monthly victory followed by **SOL** (+20%)

***January Losers*** – **AVAX** (-5%) and **BNB** (-4%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: A mixed but mostly green start to the year

In contrast to [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), this year is off to a fairly good start (the 2024 Top Ten portfolio was down -14% after one month).

**XRP** is out to an early lead (up +38% in January) followed by **SOL**, +20% so far in 2025.  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** thirty days ago is worth $138 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The portfolio gained $66 (+7%) in January so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$1,066.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, one month later: 

https://preview.redd.it/cai0brxy1bje1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=527600a5a248fa851922b1157ea4c25fce7e9d3a

**January Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +7% 
* **COIN50**: +3%

The January monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +73% (total value $1,725)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +761% (total value $8,612)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +1010% (total value $11,098) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +391% (total value $4,911)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +5% (total value $1046) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +240% (total value $3,399)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +100% (total value $1,998)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +7% (total value $1,066)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$33,855**

https://preview.redd.it/s8v0vci12bje1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf7abe1e229b0ac861308ffbb4d021049b16acc

**That’s up +323%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hbnt3pe22bje1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ca9d18c0995634af7a64b2d7b23b71313f9a5

In summary: ***That’s a +323% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,027 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,260 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,411 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,870 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,608 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,268 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,266 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,027 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,284.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+323%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

Not a bad start to the year for crypto, we’ll see what 2025 holds for the Top Ten Portfolio.   

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  January’s extended report is on the [OG 2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85).

XRP,2025-06-12,post,CryptoCurrency,Is it best to have multiple cryptos in your portfolio or to focus on one?,"I have XRP, BTC, and ETH but I’m contemplating cashing out two and going all in on one of them. Just not sure which one is the best one if this is even a good idea to begin with. I’ve been seeing predictions for the prices of these cryptocurrencies and they’re all predicting big increases in value over the next year or so, so I figured striking while the iron is hot would be a good plan. 

Any ideas on which of the above would be best to focus on? I only have less than $100 in each (late to the crypto bandwagon and not that much money to my name at the moment) but I’m hoping it’s not too late to see gains after a bit more sizable investment in one of them plus consistent DCA.

There's some really easy money in stablecoins. Management scales easily, but the return goes up with adoption. The problem is obviously that it's non-trivial to swap from one custodian to another.

I imagine with how lucrative they are every financial institution will want to have their own, plus a bunch of random people with influence. And realistically this is a perfect job for the treasury.

That is the thing. Like 99% of crypto, mfers who fund these projects don't think hard on why ppl use them. Payment is small relative to overall use, and its TAM is largely restricted to underdeveloped financial regions or places with strict capital restrictions.

Most of the stablecoin TAM is just swapping 1) crypto tokens to hedge against volatility and 2) yield farm interest rates paid by token trading or the ecosystem's development subsidies from grants/foundations' treasuries.

So you will only see sustainable growth if your stablecoin has large liquidity pools against tokens ppl want to trade. PayPal tried to do it. Initially, they ran with subsidies. Then their subsidies ran out, and growth stunted.",1

2)why do companies, banks, institutions want to create stable coin? Like many users mentions institution are very happy to give you a token in exchange for real dollars because they buy treasuries and make interest on the money you exchange for tokens. For a company is like having a bank account where you deposit money and get no interests.

But let’s be real: its top 6 spot is pure crypto hype on steroids. This chain got some redflags, and issues that would kill smaller projects. Yet it’s still mooning? Someone explain this to me, cause I’m not getting it  
  
Remember that 18-hour crash in Feb 2024? Or the seven other outages since 2021 (check Solana Status)? That ain’t “growing pains,” it’s a decentralization dumpster fire. A few validators can just hit the reset button like it’s a laggy PlayStation. If you think that’s “trustless,” I’ve got a bridge to sell you. Crypto is supposed to be bulletproof, not “oops, we’ll reboot it.”  
  
Liquid staking should be Solana’s secret sauce, but it’s hard to trust when the is this shaky. Stuff like Jito ($2.4B TVL, ), Marinade ($1.3B, tons of validators), and The Vault (vSOL, spreads stake to small validators). The Vault is cool though for trying to fix Solana’s centralization mess by backing underdog validators.

XRP,2025-04-07,post,CryptoCurrency,"What are the crypto that you will ""never"" sell because of their long-term value?","Even with the crash right now, which I don't think will stay ""crashed"" for long, I still believe some crypto projects are worth holding for the long run. Not just for price action but for real-world utility and because of actually having an underlying value, bringing something useful, or having cool technology behind them.

I'm not talking about meme coins or hype plays or selling some BTC to get Christmas presents, but tokens that you think will only rise in value later. For me, and it could be a hot-ish take, but I think proof-of-personhood is a real thing and will become important as AI grows. So for that, I still buy more and more [World](https://world.org/). There's also Chainlink, it's basically the data layer of DeFi, and ETH, which many people see as a foundation of the decentralized internet.

DCA is the best overall balance of risk/reward unless you start DCAing at the top, but then it only hurts if you DCA'd a big chunk of it over a short time period near the top. As long as you didn't happen to choose the worst possible time like that to start DCA'ing, you can just respond to a crash by either pausing the DCAing until the crash settles or simply keep DCAing.

The smaller the DCA purchases and the more frequent and smaller the time frames, the closer you approach the real average price of the total time frame. The least risky way to DCA would be some kind of micro transactions done with a smart contract on a network with minimal fees like Solana. For example DCA a tiny amount every hour, every 10 minutes, even every minute as long as it's not so frequent that the fees become significant.

The point of DCAing is to do it over the long term and not have to think about market conditions, but if you're sure it's a bear market, DCAing in a bear market would be best because you're simply buying at lower prices.

During a bear maybe a good strategy is to DCA into only strong top 5, or maybe even just bitcoin, because high market cap means you can be more confident that what you're DCAing into will actually go up during the next bull. DCAing into a shitcoin during a bear market carries a higher risk that the shitcoin never recovers, or that it suddenly collapses so much that your average buy price gets wrecked. Or maybe it's a new shitcoin but it goes up in a flash and you miss the good sell window. 

During a bull, as long as you don't get unlucky and start DCAing near the start of the bear, maybe it could work decently to spread out the DCAs into some smaller cap tokens. As long as you started early enough there may be a decent window of opportunity to sell. During a crab maybe DCA with a strategy that's mid-risky, mix of high MC and mid-MC.

Overall DCA is for balancing risk vs reward, so don't do something that throws that balance off by going into something super risky or super high reward. Maybe smart to keep an eye on stop loss orders and keep updating them so you can ensure future profits and not risk wasting all that time by missing a sell window. No strategy is riskless in crypto.",2

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the Q1 report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAY Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7+ years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** ***on the blog.***
* **APRIL Highlights:** Mostly green month, **SOL**, **BTC**, and **AVAX** outperform. **BTC** overtakes **XRP** for the overall lead - also, these are the only two cryptos in the 2025 Experiment aren't underwater YTD.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+233% vs S&P500's +54% - see below for details).

# Month Four – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/m1whfldrarze1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ff14d06b95dfdb4142d5d8179b4ae89aa5f75fa

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

April highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Lots of green, a nice opposite from last month’s red month result
* **SOL, BTC,** and **AVAX** performed best in April, and **BTC** overtakes **XRP** for the overall lead.
* YTD, only **BTC** and **XRP** are in positive territory (barely)

# April Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/8cghuh0tarze1.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=39133ce1eaab9bb8a76de6113777fb949eca507a

Four months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.

# April Winners and Losers

***April Winners*** – **SOL** and **BTC,** up +20% and +14% respectively.

***April Losers*** – A mostly flat month, but **ETH** finished down a touch in April (-2%) as did **BNB** (-1%).

# Overall Update: BTC overtakes XRP for the lead; portfolio under water; most cryptos in negative territory

After a fairly good start (the portfolio was +7% in January), the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.

Year to date **BTC** (+4%) has retaken first place and now maintains a small lead over second place **XRP** (+2%).  These two are also the only cryptos currently in positive territory in 2025.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BTC** four months ago is worth $104 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/z8fowjcvarze1.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=610e42165fe6e91b6fc795f3e5f04ccf54b8af6a

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio gained $46 in April, a welcome change from the two previous losing months. The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$822**, roughly back where it was at the end of February.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7+ years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens like I do for my Experiments).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, four months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/zodkv7p1brze1.png?width=210&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f857819b41f52c6ac2d13828b4c4743a35298f

**April Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +6% 
* **COIN50**: +9%

The April monthly victory goes to: **COIN50** (its first monthly victory)

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -20%

Overall lead: **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/99u80ju2brze1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=e253ae8b52219b367726b3373b4d338a42032f5e

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +36% (total value $1,355)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +585% (total value $6,849)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +785% (total value $8,848) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +291% (total value $3,915)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -19% (total value $810) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +157% (total value $2,569)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +47% (total value $1,471)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $822)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,638.**

https://preview.redd.it/090al9w6brze1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c90db6eb85b116880a19cdf4866fd14e7cb915

**That’s up +233%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was **November 2021’s all time high** of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hmht4k68brze1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cdc8680ddba5e429bfd1687b7605075a0744a38

In summary: ***That’s a +233% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is down -5% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $953 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,097 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,236 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,735 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,176 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,460 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,175 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $953 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,323.**

That is up **+54%** since January 2018 compared to a **+233%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  April’s extended report is on the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.

I used to add the BTC only number to my post, but haven't in a while. Can confirm those numbers are very close to what I'm tracking, good conclusion in a high BTC dominance environment.

XRP,2025-05-20,post,CryptoCurrency,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).","# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Anyone who deals with cryptocurrencies should have a hardware wallet, because it protects you even with a compromised device.

LedgerS+ is perfect for your preferences, as far as I can see.

Use the account with the seed phrase to connect to daps and do staking, but be careful what and where you sign.

Create a password that gives you a completely separate set of accounts and use it only for true cold storage.

Exchange-wallet, wallet-exchange.

Use a hot wallet for experiments.

A very good one that requires two devices (one of which is without a SIM card and always offline) to make a transaction is AirGapWallet.

Also, consider securing the following:

1. An email that you use only for crypto and 2FA, absolutely everywhere possible.

2. A reputable antivirus with a paid plan that warns you of any danger, especially financial. They are not expensive and you will thank yourself.

3. Anti-Keylogger and AntyScreenShot, free.

4. Never save passwords in the browser (I personally do not trust password managers either).

5. Add ADWcleaner and scan every 2-3 days.

6. I only use incognito mode, because it does not save history and cookies, and this is very important.

7. Delete history and clean your computer every day, no matter what. A good free program that does this is CCleaner, but you can also do it with Windows settings.

8. You know not to click on suspicious links and not to download music, movies and unnecessary programs.

9. Make sure the Host file is read-only so they can't redirect you to fraudulent sites.

10. Trust absolutely no one and never be lazy and careless with crypto.

There's probably more, but someone can add something if they want.

XRP,2025-06-27,post,CryptoCurrency,Is XRP Showing Signs of a Reversal?,"I have been tracking XRP for some time now, and I have to admit, I've been torn about how to handle this. The XRP/BTC pair has been so underperforming for such a long time, dropping to levels we haven't seen in quite some time. It left me wondering whether XRP has simply lost its place in the market, or if something is quietly developing beneath the surface.  
  
I still come across posts and videos talking about how XRP/BTC is forming a falling wedge chart pattern. My interpretation of a falling wedge is that it's a setup that can potentially turn for the better if price breaks out to the upside. Yet, simultaneously, the trend has been down for so long that it's hard not to be bearish. Technical patterns don't always pan out, especially in crypto where news, sentiment, and regulatory issues can completely overwhelm chart setups.

Another factor in mind is that while XRP may have these banking and financial institution collaborations, it does not necessarily mean healthy market performance, at least not against Bitcoin. BTC remains strong, with other coins such as XRP failing to keep up. I wonder if [XRP/BTC](https://www.bitget.com/spot/XRPBTC) can realistically stay in compliance again, or if traders and investors have largely moved to other projects with more hype or more concrete use cases.

One of the variables that continue to muddy the waters is the SEC vs. Ripple court fight. While technically that is specifically regarding XRP, I believe it has a lot of influence on XRP/BTC too, because regulatory uncertainty has traders nervous holding XRP versus holding Bitcoin. Until that gets settled, I don't know how much confidence the market is going to have, no matter what the charts are indicating

Therefore, my questions are:

1. Has anyone else been following the XRP/BTC pair very closely? Is the descending wedge something you are taking seriously, or just noise in a long downtrend?

**tldr: I'm Jung, cofounder of Lantern Finance (**[**www.lantern.finance**](http://www.lantern.finance)**), a US-based crypto lending platform built in response to the 2022 collapse of lenders like BlockFi and Celsius. Unlike them, we never rehypothecate collateral and store all assets in insured cold storage with BitGo.**

**We support loans straight to your bank account against BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, LTC, DOGE, and more. Our mission is to offer the safest, most transparent crypto-backed loans. AMA and would love any feedback!**

Hey r/CryptoCurrency!

My name is Jung, and I’m one of the founders of Lantern Finance, a US-based crypto-backed lending platform. I got started into crypto in 2016 and fell deep in the rabbit hole, having played around with several projects and platforms. In particular, I became a huge fan of BlockFi when I found out about them in 2019. The ability to borrow dollars against my crypto without selling and triggering capital gains taxes in a convenient custodial way, appealed to me.

However, fast forward to 2022, we all know what happened. The entire space imploded as we found out that crypto lenders like BlockFi, Celsius, and Voyager were rehypothecating (lending out) client collateral on an unsecured basis. They were basically double dipping - making money on the loans we took out as well as the crypto collateral we posted. I, along with millions of others, lost a decent chunk of our hard-earned crypto. 

That experience inspired my cofounders and me to build Lantern Finance ([www.lantern.finance](http://www.lantern.finance)). Lantern is a US based crypto backed lending platform that prioritizes safety of client funds over profit. Here is how we do things differently: 

* We hold borrower collateral in cold storage with BitGo, a US based qualified custodian, with insurance up to $250MM. 
* We NEVER lend out borrower collateral - they just sit in insured cold storage. 
* We lend against a broad group of blue-chip assets like: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, LTC, and DOGE. If there’s an asset you want to borrow against that we don’t support, let me know! 
* Our goal is to offer the most secure, convenient, and seamless crypto-backed lending experience for everyone.

My experience spans traditional finance, the (relatively) early crypto days, the crypto implosion of 2022, and now building Lantern, a fast growing crypto startup.

**Ask me anything and feel free to share any requests like: specific crypto you'd like to borrow against, product or features you'd want, or just general feedback. Thanks for your time and looking forward to engage!**",11

XRP,2025-06-18,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Crypto-Backed Loans AMA with Lantern Finance Cofou...,"Do you provide a watch only address so that your clients have transparency that the asset you are holding for them in cold storage remains untouched? (This would have the added benefit of allowing them to securely generate receive addresses for increasing capital in the event of an LTV mismatch for example).

What LTV are you currently offering, and how often is this to be reviewed to maintain pace with macro changes in market volatility.

What is the basic boiler plate structure of the legal agreement between yourselves and your clients (no need for detail, just the contractual structure you're using)?

Are you answerable to any government agency or regulator that could freeze or seize your assets? I am assuming that for the purposes of any legal agreement, the assets deposited as collateral are legally recognised as your assets for the purposes of forfeiture or seizure whilst you are holding them.

What is the structure of the insurance contract, and how much are you overvaluing the insurance of assets to account for growth during the pendency of your custody? Is it simply insurance that would pay out to you upon the loss of assets, or is this insurance provided to the client that requires that you pay an agreed value if the assets are not returned in line with the contractual agreement?

Does your insurance cover digital security breaches resulting in loss, or bad actor loss (i.e. a member of your team decides to compromise assets, either directly by theft, or by facilitating theft)?

Who provides recourse to a client if your business fails or activities are otherwise suspended by an event like government seizure? i.e. which institution or regulatory body is protecting clients if you act in bad faith?",6

XRP,2025-02-11,post,CryptoCurrency,"Nasdaq Files to List XRP ETF, Stating XRP Is Hard to Manipulate","Article in summary:
Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the fifth monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JULY Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7.5 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** ***on the blog.***
* **JUNE Highlights:** All flat or red, except **TRON.**  **BTC** in overall lead, **Tron** in second, **XRP** in third:  also the only three cryptos in the 2025 Experiment aren't underwater YTD. The Class of 2025 is now tied for the worst performing portfolio with the 2022 Top Ten.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 8 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+256% vs S&P500's +70% - see below for details).

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

June highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Flat or in the red 
* **Tron** outperforms the field in June
* Halfway through 2025, only three cryptos are in positive territory: **BTC, Tron,** and **XRP**  (just barely)

# June Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

Six months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# June Winners and Losers

***June Winners*** – **Tron** was the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, up +3%.

***June Losers*** – **ADA** (-20%), **DOGE** (-17%), and **AVAX** (-17%) lost the most ground this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains slight lead over Tron, portfolio under water, AVAX and DOGE in last place

Year to date **BTC** (+13%) maintains a slight lead over second place **Tron** (+9%).  The rest are either flat or in the red with **AVAX** and **DOGE** taking up the rear at -52% and -50% respectively.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BTC** six months ago is worth $113 today.

YTD the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.  The last time the 2025 Top Ten portfolio was in positive territory was the end of [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)). 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio shed $43 in June, about the same it gained in May.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$824**, roughly the same value as February and April.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, six months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/f2qhbjpec1df1.png?width=203&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73ebc7e9437656cb2507ca1b76e692af33b469e

**June Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -5% 
* **COIN50**: -3%

The June monthly victory goes to: **COIN50** (its third monthly victory in a row)

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -14%

Overall lead:  **COIN50**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +46% (total value $1,457)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +668% (total value $7,683)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +867% (total value $9,674) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +301% (total value $4,015)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $824) (***tied for worst performing portfolio****)*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +153% (total value $2,533)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +44% (total value $1,444)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $824) (***tied for worst performing portfolio****)*

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$28,453.**

https://preview.redd.it/3hokvf5hc1df1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3e611002f9049635ea66fdfbe8a44428f0d946

**That’s up +256%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/wjpim6cic1df1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=d36aecfe9946dcb52f99c9a43cf8c3ca2066a2db

In summary: ***That’s a +256% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/fa00ytcjc1df1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6630f5b664991235098b32c20312517b6fc9804

The S&P 500 is up +5% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,054 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,319 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,473 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,919 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,650 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,300 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,614 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,299 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,054 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,629.**

That is up **+70%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+256%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  June’s extended report is on the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.",46

XRP,2025-02-20,post,CryptoCurrency,Shorting Solana and Why I’m doing it (Solana Fan),"So I’m a long term solana buyer and holder.

I’ve made great returns on it, but recently I believe I miscalculated what was going to happen after the trump pump.

I was holding on to an older way of thinking, and because I didn’t sell near the trump pump high, I was waiting to get back to those highs. I’m sure many of you are doing this rn.

However I decided to get on the sideline with SOL after the Libra scandal because my profits were sliding away fast. I’m not a hodlr, I like to time the market strategically during market trends. This has worked very well for me, with some bad calls here and there.

Given that background, I’ve been conducting a significant amount of market research on Solana and want to provide you all this information so you’re not stuck in an echo chamber 

Negative Narrative:

Solana has earned its way to the scammers paradise through meme pump and dumps

Solana already had a huge run up the last 1-2 years

FTX reimbursements are entering the market soon

LIBRA scandal (there is more to this watch the coffeezilla video) this could get a lot more ugly if what’s reported is true

Potential for exchange crash. There seems to be a huge scandal on an exchange every cycle. In this case there may be a black swan event around USDC (SOL) or JUP or another platform. (This is a stretch, but if it were gonna happen somewhere I believe it would happen on the solana network this cycle)

Other networks are viewed as more reliable or for serious business like Ethereum or Cardano

Positive Narrative:

SOL can do what it’s always done, provide a network for extremely fast and cost effective transactions 

Tax feee American cryptos

That’s about it

Price movement:

Everyone is aware how poorly SOL is doing in the last 7-30 days. It’s been hit a lot worse than the rest of the market. Even though the market is in the red, SOL is significantly lower

SOL price chart shows SOL about to dump right before the Trump Pump. One could argue we would have been at the current price sooner if not for that event.

Next lower resistance is in the 150s and then the 120s. With so much FUD, I would not be surprised that if we break through 160 that we end up at 120 in a 7 day period.

Competition:

XRP has positive narratives currently and none of the negative environment that surrounds solana

Ethereum is the first mover and 2nd largest crypto. It has a huge L2 network for low fees and has a lot of room for price growth this cycle

SUI, like solana without all the FUD

Conclusion:

Given all this information, I believe SOL will reach 120s as the new low and hold in that price area for the remainder of the alt bull run while other coins prosper. 

It may go even lower once alt season ends and we are in a true bear market.

I am a huge fan of SOL, it is my favorite crypto. However my main goal is to make money, and this is how I am seeing it.

As Thanos would say, “I’m sorry little one”

I’m shorting SOL

XRP,2024-12-03,post,CryptoCurrency,Remember. You can always sell a portion of your holdings. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Make a plan.,"I constantly read people say, “Oh just my luck, I sold all my XRP to go into purple unicorn (or whatever it is) just 6 months ago! I can’t believe I missed out on this. Just my luck!”

Remember. You can always sell a portion of a holding when you hit a price target. You don’t have to liquidate the asset entirely. The key though is to have a plan, otherwise you’ll be second guessing yourself constantly with the daily/weekly pumps and dumps.

My plan? I sell a third of all my assets when the total market cap hits 4 trillion. I sell another third when the total market cap hits 7 trillion. Right now I’m not buying anything unless the total market cap dips below 2 trillion. 

I’m not saying this is a great plan, just what I’m doing. Make sure you have a plan or else you’ll be doing the flip flap trader stuff that will screw you over in the long term.

What I’m realizing more and more with each cycle is that no one really knows what’ll happen with different assets. It’s incredibly hard to pick winners. About a year ago I posted my portfolio and was clowned on. My general strategy? The majority of my holdings are in BTC and ETH. I then have a basket of the big L1s that can handle volume.  I own a total of 26 coins. Alts make up a much smaller % than BTC and ETH. 

For years people have said SOL & ADA are shit, XRP sucks, ALGO is mid, DOGE’s inflation is ridiculous, XLM and LTC are washed. Tbh, I think pretty much all cryptos are stupid including these. But I still bought them because ultimately I don’t know what will play out long term. But I figure that the gains from 1-3 coins will pay for the losses of the rest and it’s worked out so far.

Unless you’re only in BTC, I really hate the “concentration is the way to go bro, otherwise you’ll dilute your gains” perspective. Because how do you know you’re right? Look at EOS or NEO. How do you know that you picked the right winners? Now should be said, how do I know that I picked the 26 correct winners? I don’t. But generally speaking, I’ll model my portfolio after what Grayscale does so that at the least I’m riding the currents of the institutional players.

I will exit DCA eventually and sometimes I even take profits here and there but thats it. Its that simple and it works - look at Michael Saylor,6

Ethereum- similar situation. Head and shoulders above other L1’s in terms of adoption and recognisability and unfortunately they are likely more important than the actual tech at this stage 

Chainlink- Oracles are going to be more and more important with cybersecurity breaches etc. last time I checked chainlink was pretty much the market leader in this space 

I’ve currently also got a good chunk of:

Polkadot- interoperability possibilities between chains (may or may not pan out price-wise, unfortunately inflation is pretty high)

ADA- hopefully with the Voltaire era there will be pretty close true decentralisation, and with that more marketing of the project, and the security and speed is pretty great. 

Also hold another dozen or so- but those, alongside pretty much everything else I hold except for Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum I’d be willing to drop pretty quickly if I really stopped believing in their potential, so the thought of having unwavering confidence in them for another TWENTY years no questions asked is kinda scary, but doesn’t mean I don’t see potential in them in the near future.

XRP,2025-07-02,post,CryptoCurrency,Paper Wallets The Best Option?,"I'm soon going to buy my first 3 cryptos: XRP, XLM, DOGE (I'm not interested in your opinion on my investment, bear with me a little longer).  
What I intend to do is: buy the coins on an exchange, transfer them in a cold wallet, waith some month, send them all back on an exchange, sell.



From my reaserch I came to the conclusion that Trezor and Tangem are the best options for the amount (about 500€ in total) that i want to buy.



My problem? The cost 80€ (and they are even the cheapest options? wtf?), it simply seems stupit to me to spend 1/5 of my budget on storage instead of investing it as well...



My solution? Create 3 paper wallet (one for each coin), store the coins in them and when the time comes, empty the wallets on an excange all at once and sell. Since from what I understand, there's no way of keeping a paper wallet safe once you use the private key to send any amount out of it. Luckly, in my case that works out perfecly, since I intend to sell them all at once anyway.

  
What do you think about my solution? Is it outright stupid? Can it be done better? Are ther any other options that aren't any less safe and don't require me to dump 80€ on a glorified usb stick that I probably wont use again any time soon?

The private key never leaves the card, and you don’t need to manage or print anything. Works really well with XRP, XLM, and DOGE too.",6

XRP,2025-07-02,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Paper Wallets The Best Option?...,"> There's no way of keeping a paper wallet safe once you use a private key

No? It's perfectly safe, unless the device/software you use to sign the transaction is compromised. But if that's the case your trouble starts when you enter the seed phrase/private key into the software, not after you send it.",3
XRP,2025-07-02,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Paper Wallets The Best Option?...,"As others have said, you might be better off with just a software wallet. You can't send directly from a paperwallet and so you are going to need to trust a software wallet at some point anyway.


I agree with you that buying a hardware wallet for 1/5th of your budget doesn't seem sensible. In reality they only protect you from one, very rare type of loss - having your private key stolen, and even with one you can still lose your seed phrase or have it hacked if you store it electronically.


The most common ways people lose money to 'hacks' in crypto are signing things they don't understand or having malware that hijacks your clipboard while pasting addresses. Hardware wallets do not help in any way in either of these types of attack.


I'm not going to recommend any particular software wallet, as I don't currently use any of the chains you are interested in, but my suggestion would be to ask on each of the 3 relevant crypto subreddits for their suggestions and just pick one that gets recommended by all 3 groups.


EDIT - Also, fuck all the people saying that $500 doesn't matter and implying that you shouldn't care about security. How much money is a lot obviously depends on where people live and what they earn. Plenty of OGs who have done extremely well started many years ago with less than that.",3

How to set it up

1. Get a trusted device 

2. Create a bootable live USB image

3. Install a soft wallet if not included in the live image

4. Disconnect it from the network.

5. Create your wallet

6. Create a wallet seed backup as instructed by the soft wallet. This is your ""paper wallet"".

7. Take note of the wallet public key. You will need this. 

8.  Delete the wallet, and recreate it from the seed backup.

9. Verify that the public wallet key matches.

10. Store.rhe seed backup carefully at a safe location..if it is lost or stolen then your coins will be irrecoverably lost.

11. Power off and restart to your normal desktop.

12. Install a soft wallet, and create a watch-onlu wallet using the public .wallet key recorded in step 6


The watch-only wallet is used for creating receive addresses and monitor the content of your wallet. Ypu also use it to compose transactions for signing with your paper wallet. It looks and feels just like any other wallet, except that it.does not have the keys for signing any transactions.


To sign a transaction you first compose the transaction using your watch-only wallet and save the unsigned transaction as a PSBT file. As the watch-onku wallet does not have your keys it can not sign the transaction, only compose it.

Then repeat the process above, but jump ahead to recreating the wallet from your saved seed. 

1. Retrieve your paper wallet

2. Get a trusted device

3. Make a bootable USB live image and boot from it.

4. Install a soft wallet of choice, if not included in your live image.

5. Disconnect from the network

6. Recreate your wallet from the seed stored in the paper wallet

7. Load the unsigned PSBT transaction and sign it.

8. Save the signed transaction

9. Power off and restart to your normal.desktop. 

10. open your watch-only.wallet

11. Load the signed transaction in the watch-only wallet and broadcast it to.the network

12. Return the paper wallet to safe stirage


For a smoother experience I recommend using two devices..One with.your watch-only wallet,.and a small laptop for running the live image dealing with the secret wallet seed. But it works using the same computer for both.

I also recommend creating a live USB with the wallet software already installed. This way.you do not need to enable networking at all when running the live image.",2

He believes this would strengthen the U.S. dollar's status as the dominant global reserve currency, cause a drop in gold prices that could destabilize economic rivals like Russia and China, and encourage these nations to shift from traditional assets to Bitcoin. Saylor estimates that such a move could increase the value of U.S. Bitcoin reserves to $100 trillion.

Hear me out: what if regulatory approvals for assets like XRP which recently skyrocketed, alongside their stablecoin initiatives, are the way for big companies to embrace crypto payments while moving the risks associated with volatile crypto assets towards the users?

Plus, let’s not forget their moves toward launching their own ETF. This could position them to create a store of value backed by substantial market support, potentially enabling them to stabilize against market fluctuations.

Everywhere i look there's more and more discussions around the market moving towards crypto and finally accepting it, so this idea keeps popping into my head and wanted to get a second opinion? ",10

But real talk, what’s the actual issue? I’m not here to defend XRP blindly, but some of the hate feels like it’s just been recycled for years without people really understanding what they’re mad at.

Yeah, Ripple holds a fat bag of XRP. Sure, it’s got ties to banks and institutions. And no, XRP didn’t 10x like some memecoins in the last cycle. I get it. But on the flip side, a U.S. judge literally ruled that XRP isn’t a security when traded on exchanges. That’s huge. Meanwhile, half the crypto space is still waiting to find out if they’re getting bent over by the SEC.

Ripple isn’t just some startup with no real use. They’re actually building, mainly solving cross-border payment problems. And XRP transactions settle in just a few seconds and cost barely anything. It’s not just hype or guesswork.

I’m not saying XRP is perfect. But from a utility and legal clarity angle, it’s got more going for it than a lot of the projects people blindly shill every day.

So if you’re still anti-XRP, I’m honestly curious. Why? What’s the actual reason? Not the memes. Not “it didn’t moon.” Give me something real.",0

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63)***.***

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 8 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019-2025. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **EOS** easily wins March, **BNB** so far ahead overall followed distantly by **ETH** then **BTC.**
* **Total Crypto Market Cap up almost +1,350% since Jan 2020.**
* ***2020 Top Ten is best performing of the seven Experiments (+766%)***
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023+2024+2025 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +218% vs. 55% if invested same amount and frequency with S&P500**

# Month Sixty-Three – UP 766%

https://preview.redd.it/b84u0ytu1wwe1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09248fa46ebf64b5f47c87c5de34405722758c9

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

March highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **EOS** wins easily, up +20% in March
* **BNB** way ahead overall, followed distantly by **ETH**
* **EOS** in last place

# March Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/i9o8cjnw1wwe1.png?width=246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ffc41e3ef1d958f8a81afaf2e54c7184a5623cc

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after sixty-three months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** are gone.

At #90, **BSV** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

# March Winners and Losers 

***March Winners*** – **EOS,** the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, wins by far.   

***March Losers*** – **Litecoin** (-32%) lost almost a third of its value in March.

# Overall Update – BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +766%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the eight [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory. **EOS, Tezos,** and **BSV** are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin** continues to hold a significant lead, with **ETH, Bitcoin,** and **XRP** trailing distantly.

The initial $100 investment sixty-three months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$4,350**, an increase of +4,249%.    

In second place is **Ethereum,** up +1366%.

Despite a strong March, **EOS** is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -73% since January 2020.   

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/neqb52502wwe1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b243fc3542f0cab9bb3bfc68cd214630fae04d8

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth **$8,655** (+766%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the eight Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/ts7h7mp12wwe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=295c53b38f0bdfb4b699e92944972e8449c260e9

As a sector, crypto is up **+1349%** over the sixty-three month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1349%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+766%), about the same as **BTC** (+1366%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+74%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below. 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom** ended March at 61.8% and has seen a steady rise since late 2022.

Here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

# Combining the 2018-2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +25% (total value $1,249)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +542% (total value $6,420)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63): up +766% (total value $8,655) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +280% (total value $3,798)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -25% (total value $753) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +142% (total value $2,422)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +38% (total value $1,384)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -22% (total value $776)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/gcztgkj62wwe1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=295cdc99af008837d0d84e1b6ae5e644dbf31969

**That’s up +218%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/6d4h78k82wwe1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=044e096873d3d69d9faa836cefde522cccead483

In summary: ***That’s a +218% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/4qlw4w8a2wwe1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a852c449080a29e0432f98960bf4624148164a

Since the S&P 500 has returned +74% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,744 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+766%**, worth **$8,655.**

**That’s a difference of $6,911 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,107 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,744 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,182 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,467 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,181 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $958 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,387.**

That is up **+55%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+218%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined eight year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

XRP's market cap is nearing $140 billion, $2 billion more than Tether's. The cryptocurrency has seen a 15% increase over the past week and a 350% rise over the past year. This surge may be linked to Ripple Labs' recent launch of a US dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), and speculation about a potential XRP exchange-traded fund approval. Meanwhile, Tether's market cap has decreased, partly due to new EU regulations.

XRP,2025-01-26,post,CryptoCurrency,"Dean Norris, Crypto Scams, and the $1-to-$500k Dream: Lessons We Can’t Ignore","

The crypto world is wild. One minute, you’re hearing stories of someone turning $1 into $500,000 by finding the next moonshot; the next, you’re reading about Dean Norris (yes, Hank from Breaking Bad) caught up in a crypto debacle that ends with hacks and shattered trust.

This duality is what makes crypto so fascinating—and so dangerous. The “winners” of the $1-to-$500k game are rare, but the scams, rug pulls, and hacks? They’re becoming way too common. The recent DeanCoin mess is a stark reminder of how easily trust can be manipulated, especially when celebrities or influencers are involved.

So what can we learn?

	1.	It’s not always about luck—strategy matters: Yes, some people strike gold, but for every $500k winner, there are thousands who lose it all. The key is understanding why a project has value and avoiding blind bets.

	2.	DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Don’t just buy into something because a famous face is attached to it. Look into the whitepaper, the team, the roadmap, and the community. If it looks shady, it probably is.

	3.	Risk management is everything: Sure, throw a dollar or two into a meme coin for fun—but don’t YOLO your life savings into the next “promised” 1000x. Balance your portfolio and protect yourself.

	4.	Stay secure: The hacking incidents tied to these projects should be a wake-up call. Use cold wallets, enable 2FA, and be cautious about where you store and trade your info.",91

XRP,2025-01-26,comment,CryptoCurrency,"Comment on: Dean Norris, Crypto Scams, and the $1-to-$500k Dre...","The original idea of a cryptocurrency, as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned it, is a sound idea. A global currency that doesn’t require the participation of banks… with all their fees and regulations. Money you own completely, that’s also completely anonymous. 

But following the invention of bitcoin, people jumped in on the hype. Grifters, who thought to themselves “how can I capitalize on the interest in cryptocurrencies?”. And so far, many of them have been incredibly successful. 

Proof-of-work was a sound way to secure the blockchain. But it takes time and requires massive energy consumption. This makes it impractical for adaptation to the real world as a form of payment.

Some smart people thought of an alternative system - proof-of-stake. Instead of requiring computing power, proof of stake would decentralize the currency by dividing the task of verifying transactions among those who controlled the largest amount of the currency, and it would reward them with some of the currency for doing the work. 99% more efficient than proof-of-work, the system solves the two biggest initial problems with bitcoin - the length of time and the energy required to settle transactions.

But like most things, this proof-of-stake invention was not only created as a way to solve the issues plaguing proof-of-work, but also as a way to make money by capitalizing on the hype surrounding a popular idea.

Take a look at Cardano, for example - a “third generation” cryptocurrency. Its blockchain uses the proof-of-stake system.

In this system, the more money you have invested, the more the system is likely to choose you to “mint” (certify) blocks (transactions), and therefore the more likely you are to receive a cash reward (in ADA) for doing so.  

So like most assets, it makes sense that people would attempt to pool their money to raise enough capital to take advantage of the opportunity to collect revenue, just as in any other financial network or system. 

Enter pools. Pools are a collection of funds from many people that are run by a managers who agree to set up a computer on their own as a “node” to verify blockchain transactions. The more money the manager has, the more likely he is to make money from verifying those transactions. 

So the manager tries to get people to invest in his pool. Each pool can be a maximum of 64 million ADA (roughly 64 million USD at this point). Placing this maximum ensures that the currency remains decentralized. 

If successful in raising 64 million, each of the participants in the pool gain a maximum % return on their investment because they invested their money in order to gain the chance to verify transactions. This % is currently around 2-3%.

However, it’s the manager who truly profits. The manager of such a pool can charge a fee for maintaining the pool. If he charges just a simple 1%, on a saturated pool, he/she will make $640,000 annually… on OTHER people’s money. Conversely, each participant will make 2-3% on their own money only.

This system essentially creates a pyramid scheme, with those making the most return on their investment at the top, and those making the least at the bottom.  

What’s so brilliant about it, is that the system, although in some ways obviously a pyramid scheme, also potentially backs an underlying idea that humanity is trying to achieve - a completely decentralized currency that doesn’t require massive energy consumption. 

I think ultimately people will eventually wake up one day and realize it is a grift. And that bitcoin, although a cool and OG idea, doesn’t have any utility in day to day life due to the length of time it takes to complete a transaction.  

I think one day, a better digital cryptocurrency will be created - one that can’t be grifted, is reliable for day to day transactions, and is safe, secure, decentralized and easy to use. I don’t think that currency is bitcoin, etherum, cardano, or even any other coin in current existence.

At this point, I think crypto is a bubble. It’s a great idea. But no one has actually figured it out how to execute it flawlessly yet. People think they have, but they haven’t. And when enough people realize this, and that even those most “credible” coins are actually just a grift, the bubble is absolutely going to burst.",11

XRP,2025-01-19,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Reputational affects to Crypto market after this s...,"I nearly started a thread on this topic yesterday, but instead I'll post what I was going to write as a comment here, although really it's merely a roundabout way of asking the same question:

I'm starting to think that Trump is actually crypto's final boss

The reason why bitcoin was created was to remove the power to print money from privileged individuals. The paradox it brought with it was that it invited anyone who wanted to to launch their own cryptocurrency to do so and effectively have a go at printing money. 

This power is the source of all that is rotten in the crypto space, all the variants of the get-rich quick ponzi schemes and insider dealing.

When you have Trump, Musk, Bezos etc., all sitting together alongside crypto insiders, their interest is going to be how to collude with the power of the state to best harness the power to create money/tokens to further-enrich themselves. Instead of separating money from state, we appear to be ending up with an oligarchy who have the power to influence which tokens get integrated into tech platforms.

Already, with a meme coin, traded by insiders, Trump is going to make crypto look as dubious as it did with FTX and Celsius, or even more so. Tech billionaires are going to be interested in strategically integrating certain coins/tokens and certain services so that they exert maximum control over the value-accrual of the assets that they hold. This is going to be the ultimate insider trading.

Crypto will look like a farce... which realistically much/the majority of it is.

Can Bitcoin come through this again, as a credibly decentralized store of value? And can certain proof-of-stake networks come out looking like credibly neutral infrastructure upon which BTC as collateral and other services can operate?",24

The cryptocurrency is currently in an ascending channel pattern, suggesting a bullish trend with targets between $3 and $5, and possibly reaching $9 to $10. The open interest in XRP futures has hit a record high, indicating strong market activity and bullish sentiment. Additionally, the potential exit of Gary Gensler from the SEC could positively impact XRP's price by resolving Ripple's legal issues.

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56)***.***

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 7 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and again in 2024. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***

# Month Fifty-Six – UP 617%

https://preview.redd.it/l7zc9a8h0kpd1.png?width=1095&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5a9f72d8417a1215411ec08d984254efaedab9a

# August Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/sd5rvv6j0kpd1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=b11f5c42544a49afed3cb7a9d5de8338cf2cab81

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after fifty-six months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** are gone.

At #86, **Tezos** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

# August Winners and Losers 

***August Winners*** – None.  **XRP** and **Litecoin** fell the least, down -6% and -7% respectively**.**

***August Losers*** – **ETH** and **BCH** both fell -23% this month, each losing about a quarter of its value.

# Overall Update – BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +617%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the seven [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory. **EOS, Tezos,** and **BSV** are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin** continues to hold a significant lead, with **ETH** in a strong second place. **Bitcoin** is a distant third place.

The initial $100 investment fifty-six months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$3,672**, an increase of +3,572%.    

In second place is **Ethereum,** up +1,793%.

**EOS** is by far the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -82% since January 2020.   

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/debqlzql0kpd1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeaf370e9cba584a53ba46187bb6430253b9465f

As a sector, crypto is up **+959%** over the fifty-six month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+959%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+617%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+75%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below. 

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in March 2020** **(aka Zombie Apocalypse).**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3) 

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:  [**$2.6T in October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom** ended August at 56.3% and has seen a steady rise over the last few months.

Here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/j9odjl3o0kpd1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=354eba8350160590cf48a6883f2ae58655ae4be9

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth **$7,172** (+617%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the seven Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along: 

https://preview.redd.it/o36jwlsp0kpd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=287a6e5790576f9572d886f5ec37c305c98f2874

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**. 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/n43iw1xr0kpd1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=8056b9e75e0683d43eb55bd4e1a79e60a58d1afd

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/lczzs0mt0kpd1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e9914e10f9520698ca81a54e833ef2e435a265

Since the S&P 500 has returned +75% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,750 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+617%**, worth **$7,172.**

**That’s a difference of $5,422 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined seven year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

# Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  August’s extended report covers the one you’re reading here, the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56). You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.",108

XRP,2024-11-22,post,CryptoCurrency,"The ultimate crypto DCA strategy:  I analyzed 40,000+ cryptocurrencies over the past 10 years to create an optimal DCA strategy for the crypto market","Scottie Pippen, who is in the NBA Hall of Fame, tweeted the following on Sep 4th:

https://preview.redd.it/qi9x6niwwf2e1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4901c836e99762fbb3aaeaa37a0bfbb7ca2ebfc

While we can all wish Nakamoto to give us stock tips in our dreams, a more realistic strategy would be to Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into crypto.

The good news is that a lot of investors are doing that — According to the [report](https://www.kraken.com/learn/dca-strategy-crypto) from Kraken:

* 59% of crypto investors use DCA as their primary investing strategy
* 83% have used DCA to make their investment
* The most common reason for DCA was to hedge against market volatility

The bad news is that, unlike stocks, crypto markets are relatively new, and there is little information about how a DCA strategy performs over the long term. In fact, the market is so nascent that Coinbase [launched](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-launches-the-coinbase-50-index-a-global-crypto-benchmark) a crypto benchmark *(comparable to, say, the Dow or S&P 500 for the crypto world)* just last week.

# The Crypto Universe

Here is a wild stat: only \~4,300 publicly traded companies are in the U.S., but more than 15,000 cryptos are actively trading right now.

Of the more than 40,000 coins that traded in an exchange at least once in the last 10 years, only 38% are still alive. So forget about making a profit — the probability that the coin you buy will survive over the long run is only \~ 1 in 3.

[Total number of coins: 40,399 | Source: Market Sentiment Research, CoinGecko](https://preview.redd.it/b6f01cuxwf2e1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c011e93385620d8ec601036505736beb765b80)

  
What’s fascinating is that Cryptocurrencies follow the exact same [power law exhibited by the stock market](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/beat-the-market), where a few winners contribute massively to the overall market. As of Nov’24, the global crypto market cap was \~$2.9 trillion, of which $1.7 trillion *(60%)* was contributed by Bitcoin.

The top 10 coins contributed to a whopping 89% of the total crypto market. *(For comparison, the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 only contribute around 30% of the index)*

https://preview.redd.it/s6h5erp0xf2e1.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=5eef8c846cd0af095b8fb5bbf24df620dfbb59b9

# Bitcoin: DCA vs Lump Sum

The simple fact is that most of us cannot handle the volatility associated with Bitcoin.

Take a look at this fantastic chart put together by my friend at [Ecoinometrics](https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/p/ecoinometrics-drawdowns-are-opportunities)

[Crypto Drawdowns as of Oct’22 | Source: Ecoinometrics](https://preview.redd.it/korqpjz1xf2e1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeddb42715d6b178f800ec2cbf8a944e47d06625)

Holding a crypto portfolio makes the Global Financial Crisis look like a walk in the park. So, it’s natural to consider DCA as a better strategy to invest in crypto.

So, does it work?

The backtest is simple — Let’s assume that you had $100 to invest in Bitcoin every month. Either we can invest $100 every month or put $1,200 at the beginning of the year.

Here’s how your portfolio would have performed by the end of the year:

[Analysis: Market Sentiment Research | Data: CoinGecko API](https://preview.redd.it/fr4irky3xf2e1.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=0020958ae69f91559d7091666e4220fd50c0fa6e)

If you invested a lump sum into Bitcoin instead of DCA, you would have come out on top \~66% of the time. Since Bitcoin has extreme volatility, DCA outperforms only during drawdowns.

Case in point — 2018 & 2022. In both bear markets, someone who did DCA would have had a much lower drawdown than someone who invested a lump sum at the beginning of the year.

On the other hand, the same safety mechanism that helps you during bear markets will cost you during bull runs. In the 2017 Bitcoin run-up, the lump sum strategy outperformed DCA by an incredible 700%!

[DCA outperformed Lump Sum in 35.43&#37; of the 12-month periods | Rolling 12 months 2013 to 2024 | Source: Market Sentiment Research | Data: CoinGecko API](https://preview.redd.it/z2909416xf2e1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=97c5981186338cd213d97dfec6eb77e0f1d8c7f7)

So, if you have a relatively long holding period *(at least 12 months),* investing in one go is statistically better than splitting it across the year *(Given you can stomach the volatility)*.

# Building a Crypto Index

While Bitcoin is synonymous with Crypto, investing in only Bitcoin seems reckless and entirely against the whole “have a [diversified portfolio](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/importance-of-portfolio-diversification) concept”. So, what if instead of just investing in Bitcoin, we split our investments across the top 10 Cryptocurrencies based on market cap?

Before we jump into the results, here is a visualization of how the Crypto market has changed over the years *(I have removed stablecoins)*.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5amDzCTwIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5amDzCTwIU)

In this backtest, instead of investing $100 per month into Bitcoin, we equally split our investment into the $10 across the top 10 Cryptocurrencies *(as seen above in the video)* based on their market cap.

The results are stunning:

* $100 invested monthly into the top-10 cryptocurrencies starting in 2014 would have grown to $650K+ by 2018 and an incredible $1.6M+ by 2021.
* The top-10 portfolio had a CAGR of 111% *(yeah, not a typo)* over the last 10 years - And irrespective of the year you started, you beat S&P 500!
* Even with all this, the Bitcoin-only portfolio gave a better risk adjusted return.

https://preview.redd.it/ii9rph5gxf2e1.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3662e39944a84c127e85bc1193af6ab5baea6b

[Source: Market Sentiment Research](https://preview.redd.it/1c44d2ngxf2e1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea526c2451a94878d92526ef87ab0f215659213a)

What’s interesting is that, after 10 years, both strategies have comparable final portfolio values *($1.02M for Top 10 DCA & $950K for bitcoin DCA).* This mainly comes down to alt-coins having extreme drawdowns during bear markets.

While the top-10 strategy beat bitcoin-only strategy, it did so with a much higher portfolio volatility. Case in point — after the run up in 2018, your top-10 portfolio would have had a drawdown of 94%! This extreme volatility meant that a bitcoin-only portfolio provided a better risk adjusted return.

Even though both portfolios had incredible performance, crypto was barely a known asset in 2014. What if you had started late? Would your returns be significant enough to follow this strategy?

[Buy & Hold Portfolio returns | Source: Market Sentiment Research](https://preview.redd.it/y98683bjxf2e1.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=342fc9382b2fbd91e83a4b779694b7e998224b14)

No matter which year you started, both portfolios provided significant ROI and beat the S&P 500 by a wide margin.

# Why diversification wins during bull markets:

In stock market, concentrated bets are more likely to provide better returns since market cannot move so much. But given the relatively small size of the crypto market, there are benefits to splitting your investments.

To explain the outperformance of the top-10 portfolio, let’s take the example of Ripple (XRP). Ripple was the third largest coin at the beginning of Jan 2017 — But it only had a market cap of $240 million.

2017 was incredible for the crypto ecosystem. The overall market cap jumped by 25 times. But when you look closely,

* Bitcoin — 12x in 2017
* Ripple — **262x in 2017**

https://preview.redd.it/1p75m3rmxf2e1.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=69d9d01b6cca9ec5a9e4299ea147f59b44d6579f

Extrapolate this across other coins and you can see how holding alt-coins can be valuable during bull markets.

# Tokenized ETFs

With the launch of [Coinbase 50 Index](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-launches-the-coinbase-50-index-a-global-crypto-benchmark), we are hopeful that more and more players will move into this ecosystem to bring low-cost index funds to the market. Right now, the only comparable and established option is the [Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.bitwiseinvestments.com/FactSheet/bitwise10/Bitwise-10-Crypto-Index-Fund-Fact-Sheet.pdf) which invests in the top 10 cryptocurrencies based on market cap.

While the fund has a 5-year CAGR of 45%, it’s hard to recommend it given the extraordinarily high expense ratio of 2.5%. The optimal strategy would be to get in now to get exposure and shift to future funds having a lower expense ratio once the market matures.

# Optimal Allocation to Crypto

Since asset allocation is the [most important decision](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/the-most-important-thing) in investing, it’s interesting to see how much of your portfolio you should allocate to crypto.

Analysts at [Quantpedia](https://quantpedia.com/how-much-bitcoin-should-we-allocate-to-the-portfolio/) created an equal-weight portfolio of globally diversified asset classes, including Bitcoin, and used the [Markowitz model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model#:~:text=In%20finance%2C%20the%20Markowitz%20model,portfolios%20of%20the%20given%20securities.) to find the optimal allocation to Bitcoin.

They split their analysis time periods into 2:

1. **2013 to 2017** — Bitcoin was an obscure asset class before exploding into popularity in 2017. This period had significant volatility, and Bitcoin grew at a remarkable rate of 283% CAGR. If you only used the data from this time period, the **optimal allocation to Bitcoin would be 14.4%**. But, using this time period is unrealistic as it’s very unlikely for Bitcoin to grow at the same pace it did in the initial year *(due to base effect)*
2. **2018 to 2023 —** During this time, Bitcoin matured as an asset class, attracting the attention of institutional investors — At the same time, the growth rate slowed down, and the high volatility meant that Bitcoin only had a Sharpe ratio of 0.31 compared to 0.59 of the S&P 500, and 0.53 of gold. If you consider only this time frame, **the optimal allocation to Bitcoin will be only 2.94%.**

To put a long story short, the optimal crypto allocation is somewhere between 3% and 14% depending on how bullish you are in crypto.

It certainly is alluring to be that guy who can now retire after making a $17 investment in the right cryptocurrency. But then again, you have similar chances of winning the lottery.

Certainly, you can invest in one currency if you completely believe in its long-term prospects and viability. For the rest of us who might not have the time and capabilities to research and invest in individual cryptocurrencies, I guess the 10,000%+ return on your invested amount is plenty good enough!

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

April highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **BCH** and **BTC** turned in the strongest performances this month
* **BNB** is still miles ahead overall, followed very distantly by **XRP**.
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +291% in fifty-two months

# April Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/wxb7palm1j2f1.png?width=306&format=png&auto=webp&s=81a32553bd0b934dfbd8de9f1e8db5dca9eda1cf

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  fifty-two months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, only four cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**

# April Winners and Losers

***April Winners*** – **BCH** (+18%) followed by **BTC** (+14%).

***April Losers*** – **ETH** turned in the worst performance, down -2% this month.

# Overall Update – BNB dominates, XRP in distant second place, 80% of cryptos in green, DOT worst performing

As has been the case for most of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, **BNB** remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far.  It is up **+1,458%**, the $100 investment into **BNB** fifty-two months ago now worth **$1563.**  

**XRP** is in distant second place, up +821% followed by **ADA** (+295%) in third place.

At the bottom, **DOT** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-52%** since January 2021. 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/epttbfjo1j2f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3cbf560ada6acfbc8174d4f3314e9fcb46ff71

**BitDom** has been up only lately, now sitting at 63.8% and has been on an uptrend since early 2023. 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/j0k55pxq1j2f1.png?width=222&format=png&auto=webp&s=481469156f973b36740c22079511a0a93590ab00

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +291%.  The initial $1000 investment fifty-two months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$3,915**. 

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the eighth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, at the height of a crypto bull run.  Where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +36% (total value $1,355)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +585% (total value $6,849)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +785% (total value $8,848) (***best performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +291% (total value $3,915)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -19% (total value $810) (***worst performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +157% (total value $2,569)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +47% (total value $1,471)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $822)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,638.**

https://preview.redd.it/yz6heaky1j2f1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d41f8911a55f74949c72103f8d2f199433088bf

**That’s up +233%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was **November 2021’s all time high** of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/nifx6dc02j2f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=879edb67a565b783637af8a160e2792984eb4787

In summary: ***That’s a +233% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/taqjnhl32j2f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=847da29551ee95cac60d44cedc514e1fff8b5a84

The S&P 500 Index is up **+49%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto fifty-two months ago would be worth **$1,492** had it been redirected to the S&P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+291%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto fifty-two months ago is now worth **$3,915.**

That’s a difference of **$2,423** on a $1k investment in fifty-two months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,097 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,236 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,735 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,176 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,460 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,175 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $953 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,323.**

That is up **+54%** since January 2018 compared to a **+233%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined eight year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&P up to this point:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.  

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.  A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  April’s extended report is on the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio (the one you’re reading now).  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2025 Top Ten reports as well.",99

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 OCT Snapshot).**

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I created a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and again in 2024 because I'm a glutton for punishment (and to show different entry points).
* ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **SEPTEMBER HIGHLIGHTS:** **LINK** and **ADA** turned in the strongest performances this month. **BNB** continues to maintain a strong overall lead, followed very distantly by **ETH**. 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196% in forty-five months vs. the S&P500's +52%.
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023+2024 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +196% compared to +65% in the S&P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments.**



# Month Forty-Five – UP 196%

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

September highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **LINK** and **ADA** turned in the strongest performances this month
* **BNB** is still way out in front overall, followed very distantly by **ETH**.
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196% in forty-five months

# September Ranking and Dropout Report

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  forty-five months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, five cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Cardano, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**

# September Winners and Losers

***September Winners*** – **LINK** (+17%) and **ADA** (+16%) performed the best in September

***September Losers*** – **LTC** turned in the worst performance, but still gained +7% this month.

# Overall Update – BNB dominates, ETH in distant second place, 70% of cryptos in green, DOT worst performing

As has been the case for most of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, **BNB** remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far.  It is up **+1399%**, the $100 investment into **BNB** forty-five months ago now worth **$1503.  ETH** is in distant second place, up +256% followed by **XRP** in third place and **BTC** in fourth place.

At the bottom, **DOT** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-48%** since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/w4g2d6v4naxd1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1646f64a74910d2539ace55a243f19b2b0fef9b

**BitDom** has bounced a bit since the beginning of the year, now sitting at 55.8% and is generally on an uptrend since early 2023. 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196%.  The initial $1000 investment forty-five months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$2,962**. 

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

As most readers are aware, this is the sixth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of a crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +2% (total value $1,021)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +440% (total value $5,401)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +697% (total value $7,967) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +196% (total value $2,962)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -44% (total value $558) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +71% (total value $1,714)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +8% (total value $1,080)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,703**

**That’s up +196%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/zjg53279naxd1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe39782bf853a8d54822ed48edc89f1192509d2b

In summary: ***That’s a +196% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/yx1ad7kanaxd1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a29e74e79830e5a489b6e87d36a7620103f4101

The S&P 500 Index is up **+52%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto forty-five months ago would be worth **$1,520** had it been redirected to the S&P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+196%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto forty-five months ago is now worth **$2,962.**

That’s a difference of **$1,442** on a $1k investment in forty-five months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,136 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,278 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,767 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,520 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,198 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,487 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,197 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+65%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+196%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined seven year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&P up to this point:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.  

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

1.  I sold icp for eth and eth quit moving

4.  Then xrp started moving so I converted all the ""spread"" to xrp.
5.  I am hoping xrp will continue to move.

XRP,2024-12-11,post,CryptoCurrency,Who sets the price for crypto?,"Im new to crypto and I'm wondering how the price is made.

Of course high demand means higher price. But how does it work in detail? At stocks i can put a price limit for buying and selling. If somebody else has a buy/sell order with that price limit a stock deal is made. A difference between buy and sell prices would be a spread.
So basically the stock price consists of those buy/sell limits.

So when i bought XRP at my crypto app i couldn't put a price limit for the buy order. I can choose to buy a specific amount or for a specific value.

I can only buy/sell at the current value. If neither the buyer nor the seller can really choose the price, who sets the value for that moment? I hope i could explain the misunderstanding.",0

* Before that, buying gold was a pain: you needed to buy coins, bars, or risky mining stocks.
* Suddenly, overnight, *anyone* could buy gold via a ticker symbol.
* The result? Gold’s price went from about $400 an ounce to over $1,800 in under a decade—a 4.5x move. The reason: ETFs funneled **hundreds of billions of dollars** into gold that simply *couldn’t* access it before.

* **Bitcoin ETF flows:** After the January 2024 approval, spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted over **$15 billion** in their first 120 days. That’s new money, not just retail but pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies—people who couldn’t touch Bitcoin before.
* That $15 billion took Bitcoin to new all-time highs, while the rest of the market was still in consolidation.

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MARCH Snapshot).**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, no selling or trading, reporting monthly for over 7 years.

# Month Seventy-Four – UP 588%  

https://preview.redd.it/n00759ayy8pe1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b79512b1fc134b05b495e76503c8d4af5b4145

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,** and **Tron**.  

February highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio: 

* Bloody month, as all cryptos end February in the red except **Litecoin**
* **Ethereum** knocked out of first place by **Bitcoin**, which maintains a strong overall lead since January 2019 (+2,170%).  Third place is **Tron.**

# February Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/4pe0d81zy8pe1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c45df9d903505a45b43c0fc60faa4c7857193a

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:** After seventy-four months, 50% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)  have been knocked out.

**BSV** has fallen the furthest in rank so far (#92).

# February Winners and Losers 

***February Winners*** – **Litecoin** (+0.3%) outperformed the rest of the Top Ten by breaking even.  

***February Losers*** – Tough month for the E coins: **ETH** and **EOS** lost -32% and -31% respectively.

# Overall Update: BTC surpasses ETH for the overall lead.  80% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS in the basement.

**Bitcoin** (+2,170% since Jan. 2019), trailing **Ethereum** in the 2019 Portfolio for years, has now overtaken second place **ETH.** 

**The $100 investment into first place BTC on** [**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) **is currently worth $2,314.**

After seventy-four months, 80% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. The worst performer is **EOS** (-78%)**.**

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/fwx03hoxz8pe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=a57b3895f94615c9acef66f159b90d68a73d7836

There was no easy way to do so at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire cryptocurrency market since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), you would be up +2,124%

This is still behind first place **BTC** (+2,170%) but just barely and much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place **Ethereum** (+1,511%).  

The total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+588%) as well.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/trhpfuryz8pe1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=0300273dcbe95ee16a96589295cd632da73ea8ef

**BitDom** ended February at 60.1%.

For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022.**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/2dh8376109pe1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d27b97a1ef68e7875b5e44640e4fa3c76922143

After seventy-four months, the value of the initial $1000 investment is **$6,875** up +588%. This is down from [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35) of +665% for the 2019 Portfolio. 

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up +588%, it is not the best performing of the eight Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment Portfolios: it is still a distant second place behind the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56) which is up +809% at the moment.

* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

So overall? Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/0caly35b09pe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a6f4795b187b6c3804a030f432e151c73bb19f

**That’s up +237%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/b4gn25xc09pe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb3192318ac4312f1a44ab35e776cd65dfb838a8

In summary: ***That’s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/1yw205ii09pe1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd0689ede225b41ecfc11a8c7a490ea3c80d11e

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 138% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto seventy-four months ago would be worth $2,376 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019. 

But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

Here’s a table providing an overview of the eight year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:

# Conclusion:

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you truly can’t afford to lose. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for the latest progress reports.

XRP,2025-05-28,post,CryptoCurrency,XRP reddit removed this post:,"This statue was funded by Ripple to discredit Bitcoin. Greenpeace had this beauty made after receiving funding from Ripple do bash Bitcoin.

That’s the thing you lot are investing in - this is not an opinion but a fact. Give it a thought, why does Ripple do this? Why does it think it needs to do this? Is this the place you want to put your money on?

Free world, free choice.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. It’s on display at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas at the moment.

So this was what they removed, which says a lot about the people involved.

Honestly, how are people still buying the XRP dream in 2025? Ripple has been dumping on retail for years and somehow folks still act like it’s the next big thing. The Ripple foundation (or whatever they call themselves now) keeps unlocking billions of XRP from escrow and selling it straight into the market. Like clockwork. Retail gets excited about some vague announcement, and boom — here comes the dump. Every. Single. Time.

And can we talk about use case for a second? Who is actually using RippleNet? Like, seriously. Go ahead, I’ll wait. There’s no real volume. No big adoption. Just partnerships that sound impressive on paper and end up being “pilots” that go nowhere. It’s all smoke. And mirrors. And more smoke.

Meanwhile, the banks Ripple was supposed to “disrupt” have made it clear they want stablecoins. Not XRP. Not volatile tokens that dump 30% on a Tuesday because the market hiccupped. They want compliance-friendly, fiat-pegged coins they can actually use without scaring off regulators. USDC, USDT, maybe a CBDC or two — not your grandma’s XRP bag.

And yes, let’s not forget the lawsuits and the regulatory “clarity” that’s always juuuust around the corner. Same story since like 2018. At this point it’s just hopium. XRP isn’t a revolution, it’s a nostalgia project. Like MySpace for blockchain. Except MySpace had actual users.

The community’s down bad but still talking like it’s 2017 moon season. Wake up. Ripple isn’t taking over the banking world — it’s taking your liquidity and thanking you for the exit liquidity.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. Thanks for reading my rant and hope to see you on team bitcoin, to make an actual positive impact for our world and not just for the banks.

Ceo:
The Skull of Satoshi was originally built to call attention to blockchain energy usage, and today it’s a symbol and reminder of Bitcoin’s incredible staying power to many around the world (including me!).

As crypto and blockchain technologies become widely used, respected and understood – it’s past time that we set aside our differences and work together to move the industry forward.

XRP,2024-10-09,post,CryptoCurrency,What needs to happen for the flippening and is it possible at all?,"Everybody probably knows this but for those who dont the flippening is a theory where ETH surpasses BTC in market cap. Lots of people believe this is technically possible - But for this to happen some indicators have got to be in Ethereums favor

EIP-4844 - proto-danksharding - dropped transaction costs and boosted Layer 2s potential to scale. Arbitrum, Optimism and recently even Base are getting more volume and all of this will make Ethereum dominate decentralized exchanges - It could double its current DEX volume relative to the mainnet

Following up on the Layer 2 topic - Ethereum keeps growing through its Layer 2 chains. Its possible that Layer 2s can handle more value and transactions than the mainnet in the future - But wouldnt that have a negative impact on the mainnet?

All things considering Bitcoin is still the favorite of institutional investors even though Ethereum has dominance in Defi and NFTs. ETH has outperformed BTC in terms of price growth in some cycles and it can probably do it agan - But long term not sure if it can actually flip BTC so I would like to read some insights.

XRP,2025-05-06,post,CryptoCurrency,Trying to understand how the ups and lows of cryptocurrency work,"I got into crypto currency a couple of weeks ago, after some recommendations in this sub I opened a Kraken account and invested a bit into 6 coins, one of them being BTC. I'm quite tight on money so I didn't invest much, around $10-$15 into each, the idea was to buy a little when it's low, and maybe in some years enjoy a sudden boom like BTC had. 

I bought a fraction of BTC when it was around 80K and now, when it's 95K and up I'm wondering why what I bought hasn't gone up in price too, but only in couple of cents. 
Is it because the fraction of BTC I bought is so small? or am I missing something. 

Speaking of, if anyone has any suggestions as to what to invest in, I'd love to hear it. I have the regular coins like Sol and ETH and Ondo, I was recommended XRP too but I think Kraken doesn't have it, and a lot of people mentioned tokens too.

Thanks in advance. ",1
XRP,2025-05-06,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Trying to understand how the ups and lows of crypt...,"If you bought 10$ worth of BTC at 80k and the price has gone up to $95k, that's a 15% increase.. so your 10$ should be worth 11.50$

However, this also depends on fees - if you spent 10$ on BTC, you likely received less than 10$ in BTC when fees are subtracted. So this could also explain

XRP,2025-05-06,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Trying to understand how the ups and lows of crypt...,"You need to invest many many orders orf magnitudes more to actually make an effect on the price yourself.

Price just works like stock markets, it's driven by the market, the supply and demand. People are offering coins for fiat, and fiat for coins, where those two opposite offers meet, that's the price. If someone wants to instantly buy the, they eat the nearest offer, and slightly widen the gap between that supply and demand, and more offers fill it, and the price can move a little up, and if someone instantly sells, it eats the nearest offer on the other side pushing the price down. This tug of war of supply (people offering to sell, and people selling) and demand (people offering to buy and people buying) is what controls the price.

I personally only invest in coins that I think are either big safe bluechips like bitcoin, or very innovative quality tech that has the potential to be big in the future and I'd like to see it suceed as it could bring the best safety and utility to the ecosystem, like cardano. We should all have priorities like that supportive of the actual tech, and that would tremendously help actual adoption, and help stop making the crypto looks like a jokes or scams. And help make the crypto actually live up to its full potential and give us the best useful utility services it can provide.",3

A lot of newcomers think spreading small amounts across many coins will improve their odds, hoping one takes off. But in crypto, that kind of diversification doesn’t work like it does in traditional investing. Most altcoins are closely tied to Bitcoin; they rise and fall together, so you’re not really spreading risk, just multiplying your exposure and increasing your volatility and uncertainty. On top of that, the space is full of low-quality projects and outright scams. Throwing money at random coins just increases your chances of ending up with something worthless.",3

XRP,2025-02-03,post,CryptoCurrency,Feeling stupid,"Kinda felt like venting cuz I feel quite silly now  - I'm quite new to buying crypto but recently, about 2 months ago, I bought into some XRP. Admittedly I got onto the bandwagon after hearing a mate speak quite positively about it, but after doing a little bit of research, I understand the use case for the technology and felt that buying into it could be a good investment for the future if it could reach even half of what ETH did (I'm no expert and have ALOT to learn, but i figured hoping that it would reach bitcoin levels of success is a bit naive).

So, I bought some when it was just over $2 then about a week later it started rising to over $3 in value. At this point I was kicking myself for not buying more but told myself that it's ok and that I can buy more when it dips again. Fast forward to this past weekend, I had some extra cash that I wanted to use to purchase more and noticed that it had started dipping significantly on Saturday. Nows the perfect time for me to buy more, i thought to myself, since I didn't know if it's going to rise again before I get a chance to buy. So I jumped at the opportunity to buy. Since then, it has dipped even more and I find myself kicking myself once again for not waiting longer before buying. I haven't put in a huge amount of money, and the current loss isn't a disaster, but my terrible timing has left me feeling rather stupid.",0

# July Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks seven months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/j8338mjtemjd1.png?width=406&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d336a6db233cfd6f0dadcfbe55c70d864058660

Not a lot of surprises so far in 2024, with only **DOT** and **AVAX** dropping out of the Top Ten.

# July Winners and Losers

***July Winners*** – **XRP** easily wins the month, up +22%. **SOL** (+12%) in second place in July.

***July Losers*** – **DOT** (-17%) fell the most this month, followed closely by **AVAX** (-16%).  This was **AVAX**’s second rough month in a row.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, SOL in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory. ADA, AVAX, and DOT in virtual tie for last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+79%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **SOL** (+47%). **BTC** (+43%) is third.

Seven months into the 2024 Experiment **ADA, AVAX,** and **DOT** are in a virtual tie for last place, each down approximately -40%.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** seven months ago is worth $179 today.

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $13 in July.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$1,102.** 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Seven  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/y664h9b2fmjd1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=a546df7df80d244c01690a04571c1d99d5654699

**July Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -1% 
* **AMKT**: -2%.

The July monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** +10%
*  **AMKT:** +31%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**, with over triple the ROI of the Top Ten Portfolio.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +12% (total value $1,102)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +470% (total value $5,697)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50): up +736% (total value $8,357) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +203% (total value $3,033)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -43% (total value $570) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +77% (total value $1,775)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-7): up +10% (total value $1,102)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$21,637.** 

**That’s up +209%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/9ec71uv5fmjd1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=0523e8b58b85ee48dbe45a3503f20b1d1bbbebcb

In summary: ***That’s a +209% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +14% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,140 had it been redirected to the S&P.  As of August 1st, the S&P would have been a better place for my initial $1k than my Top Ten Crypto investment.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,040 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,170 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,690 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,450 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,140 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,420 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,140 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,050.**

That is up **+58%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+209%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  July’s extended report is on the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.

XRP,2025-02-14,post,CryptoCurrency,XRP: Fomo or Truth?,"
Hi guys,

after yesterday’s news XRP has gotten up 12% and I was wondering whether (in case it gets finally approved) XRP could do a 10x/100x or just do an Ethereum.

I’m kinda new to altcoins (previously lost 85% on memecoins) and was wondering whether the reports were true or just XRP holders looking into getting exit liquidity.

I, a few months back, saw something similar for SOL after the mini crash/market correction and it went up 40%. 

I do obviously understand that there is some exaggeration by the XRP holders. But just to know whether it’s a meme-intended exaggeration or a realistic/ possible outcome.

Thanks to anyone who answers!v

XRP,2025-03-11,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: XRP: Fomo or Truth?...,"I hope this clarifies how xrp works:

Let’s say $100 billion needs to be moved by banks through the use of xrp. There are 100 billion tokens. That means at $1 they would need to use all 100 billion tokens in existence. Let’s say we factor in available tokens of the circulating supply (not held by retail, banks, institutions, etfs, etps, and ripple etc) now we get a much smaller number. Let’s say 50 billion circ supply goes down to 30 billion. Now that $1 xrp is now $3. Now let’s say banks are moving on the ledger what swift moves in a day which is $5 trillion. This is the milestone many in the community look towards. That $3 token is now $133

JP Morgan facilitates $10 trillion worth of payments per day. Their MC is not $10 trillion. If a token were used to facilitate these payments, and there were 50 billion of these tokens available how much would that token need to be worth to move that amount of money? $200. What about 40B tokens, 30B, 25B, you get the idea. Banks won’t sell any tokens being used for payments, just to buy them back again for payments. So those tokens are just being circulated within the ecosystem, forever shrinking due to burning. The top 5 banks in the US move approx $40T a day. That’s just the US. $50T @ 25B available tokens is $2k a token

I am not saying xrp will be at a circulating supply of 25B and will be moving $50T. This is just easy numbers to explain the mechanics of how xrp can scale to large amounts in order to move money around the world. I think the next two years will be very interesting in the utility space, with the big winners being xrp as well as a handful of others that offer true utility and value. We have never had price action due to utility and not trading volume, but I believe it will shatter most of the current thoughts on crypto, and the role of MC and supply

RWA tokenization is a whole nother beast, and is over $2 quadrillion, which the XRPL is expected to gain a market share of. That’s probably better left for another post. Best of luck.

While the arithmetic is interesting, it relies on some assumptions that may not hold in practice. For example, dividing total daily transaction volume by circulating supply presumes each XRP token is used only once per day, which doesn’t account for the token’s velocity in real-world transactions. Also, market prices are driven by a combination of demand, investor sentiment, and broader economic conditions, not just a simple ratio of total value moved to available tokens. Alot of people try to act like XRP is pure utility, but 99% of the people that ponder this are speculating. Reaching an absurdly high price (enough to make smaller investors rich) would require market dynamics that are much more complex than what the description above is suggesting. Hope this helps!",4

Hello liar, I am here once again to point out you're lying. its a public blockchain, You were specifically told this isnt true 16 days ago.  Also Ripples funds are locked in escrow, I will once again be reminding you that I will always be around to call out ur bullshit.

A quick recap for you because looking at a public blockchain to check wallets was too difficult for you to understand.

Jed took 9% in 2012, he now owns 0%. (does not work for ripple/doesnt run it anymore)

Arthur took 2% in 2012, we dont know how much he still has

Larsen took 9% in 2012 and has Sold ~4-5% of that since then.

David took 0%

Ripple was given 80% in 2012, they now have ~42.9% ish the majoirty of which is locked up in 55 month long escrow contracts which are Also publicly viewable on chain.

here is some of them below

Eg ripple owns <50% of xrp now, doesn’t make it ideal but does show your flawed info. Please share the 4 wallets holding 80bn? Can’t cause the escrow has 2 wallets per month for each 1bn ripple holds 

I would consider myself a part of any “xrp army” and even though such a label was meant as a negative it’s hard not to see a value in a large supportive community. 

Even without getting into core desired use cases i would argue most cryptos value is tied to the size and resilience of their community. Sure like any big city the increased size increases the bad things (or gob shytes and moon bois) as well as the good but if size of community and quality of the good stuff has some worth then i’ll happily bet on that with xrp. This army has been at war and not quit for the last 5 years so hard not to see the longevity for the future too

Anyone making price predictions is plucking numbers out the air and likely full of shit, that does however also go for your “iT canT dOuBlE” low price call. 

Only time will tell but if you wish to flash back to days before “the bankers coin” fought a battle against the sec “jack booted thugs” clichee of old then note xrp was the largest gainer of the 2017/18 bull run with over 20,000% aka 200x gains so hard to say what is or isn’t possible.

Or, on the other extreme, you put in a $50k contract and then in 45 days you get back 96k.  You double your 50k in 6 weeks???  I don't see how this is possible.

XRP,2025-05-31,post,CryptoCurrency,They’ll Ask You to Lease It,"The Buyback Myth

Why XRP May Be Priceless, But Never For Sale

A quiet meeting. No headlines. No cameras.
Just a question on a piece of paper:

“How much do you want for your XRP?”

You write a number. Maybe it’s $10,000.
Maybe it’s $1 million.

The official nods, takes the paper, and walks away.

You don’t get a counteroffer.
You don’t get a thank you.

You get one thing: silence.

Because it was never about what your XRP was worth to you.

It was about what it’s worth to them. The institutions, the banks, the architects now installing the very system XRP was built for.

There’s a story circulating in the corners of crypto. Dismissed in headlines, laughed at in forums, whispered in backchannels. The story of an XRP buyback. That one day, governments or central banks might attempt to reclaim it, not because of hype, but because they can’t run the new system without it.

Sounds like fantasy. Until you ask a deeper question.

What happens when a digital asset becomes more valuable as infrastructure than as an investment?

Most tokens are priced on speculation, scarcity, or hype. But XRP wasn’t built for speculation. It was engineered as a universal liquidity key. A rail between systems. A bridge across jurisdictions. A resolver of value between incompatible ledgers.

Its value isn’t in its rarity. It’s in its reach.
Its future isn’t in trading. It’s in transaction.
And that changes everything.

Because when a token becomes essential to the function of a quantum-governed, AI-regulated, tokenized financial world, its market price becomes irrelevant. It stops acting like an asset and starts acting like infrastructure. Not something you invest in. Something the system can’t function without.

And what do institutions do with infrastructure?

They don’t speculate on it.
They standardize it.
They regulate it.
They reclassify it.
And sometimes they nationalize it.

This isn’t unheard of. Governments have seized or recalled assets before. From gold in the 1930s to wartime resource control. When an asset becomes vital to national or global infrastructure, private ownership becomes a liability.

Some have speculated that XRP holders may not be forced to sell, but instead invited to lend their tokens to corporations, banks, or governments in need of liquidity. These contracts would offer compensation. Yield, access, or rewards in exchange for access to XRP’s utility. You wouldn’t sell your XRP. You’d stake it into the machine. Your wallet remains yours, but your liquidity becomes leased.

It’s not a buyback. It’s custody under a different name.

Like Prometheus stealing fire or Pandora opening the box, the myth of the buyback isn’t about the event.
It’s about what it reveals.

So maybe the story of the million-dollar token isn’t literal.
Maybe it’s just a shadow of the truth.

That at some point, XRP will stop being a token to sell and start being a permissioned instrument.
That by the time the world understands its purpose, ownership will already be constrained.

Because the moment XRP fulfills its design as a universal bridge, it stops being a market asset.
It becomes a utility of the system itself.

And in that moment, the real question won’t be “How much is it worth?”

It will be “Are you even allowed to use it?”

Maybe that’s why you hold it.
Not just as an investment, but as a stake in the system before the gate closes.

⸻

TLDR:
The XRP buyback theory might not happen literally, but its logic reflects a deeper truth. If XRP becomes essential infrastructure for the next financial system, it will outgrow price. You won’t need to sell it. You’ll be asked to lease it. And eventually, it may no longer be yours to trade.",0

# September Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks nine months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/62rrkacbqbvd1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=545efba827a6478d225a4dbda2d3451b8fe68b8b

Other than **DOT**’s significant fall, not a ton of movement in the Top Ten.

# September Winners and Losers

***September Winners*** – **AVAX** (+34%) and **DOGE** (+24%) performed the best this month.

***September Losers*** – **ETH** (+8%) and **DOT** (+10%) gained the least in September.

# Overall Update: BNB retains strong lead followed by BTC and SOL.  60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+82%) remains in the overall lead, nearly doubling second place **BTC** (+42%).  Third place **SOL** made up a lot of ground in September and is now +40% YTD.

Nine months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -48% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** nine months ago is worth $182 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $134 in September.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$1080.**  

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Nine  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/7h869symqbvd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=d483a91400703e13a2de518bf60e0eca91db5d6d

**September Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: +14% 
* **AMKT**: +23%

The September monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** +8%
*  **AMKT:** +33%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’m using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/0cgmubypqbvd1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa2dc1e0389211f855899426bd17712999db490

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +2% (total value $1,021)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +440% (total value $5,401)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +697% (total value $7,967) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +196% (total value $2,962)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -44% (total value $558) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +71% (total value $1,714)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up +8% (total value $1,080)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,703**

**That’s up +196%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/4bu7v5hrqbvd1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=64cdb13580c7aded3d3b04a7ed9486bdfe07903a

In summary: ***That’s a +196% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/1j0sksisqbvd1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d015c34b7167c1f63d664ab2d71c7b26b04577

The S&P 500 is up +20% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,197 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,136 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,278 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,767 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,520 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,198 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,487 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,197 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+65%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+196%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  September’s extended report is on the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well. and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.",93

I do wonder if you went back in time with some new variation of this and what it would look it.

The most notable one would be selling everything at the end of each year and reinvesting into the new top 10.  Could give some wild results

XRP,2025-01-16,post,CryptoCurrency,"If the US is going to choose other coins for crypto reserve, what will they be?","There is a lot of discussion here about the fact that possibly America will have a different cryptocurrency other than bitcoin that is used as part of the strategic national cryptocurrency reserve.

We don’t have a lot of time to figure this out and I’m curious what coins you believe might be included in the reserve and what coin should be acquired as part of this.

I have heard that Solana may be included in Trump’s chosen few but what other coins could there be?

I understand that bitcoin could possibly be included, but I’m curious about what other coins include. 

Hopefully, I can receive some guidance

The time to use whatever reserve we have left will soon be upon us, because that national debt is getting pretty large, and I'm doubting if we can even afford 4.5 % interest on it, and that rate is likely to go much higher, once the world figures out how F-ed we are, and this administration makes sure our deficits are the Bestest Evar.

XRP,2025-03-09,post,CryptoCurrency,White House Crypto Summit Bearable Guy Riddle,"Reposting here because I know users appreciate these posts but mods deleted from XRP subreddit because they hate their own community::

I am starting to convince myself that in the Bearable Guy Rumor it refers to the Whitehouse Crypto Summit:

  
Red AI puppet guy is David Sacks

The King is Michael Saylor who is using a leverage instrument aka a wrench. He used to carry a sceptre with an infinity symbol but also looks like a bitcoin. This is the ""infinite money glitch.""

The dork on the far right is Sergey Nazarov

The twins are the Winklevoss twins (who wear similar colors in their twitter profiles)

The knight is Brad.

Bearable guy has three jokers (Joker=Trump card)

For some reason, in user twitter handle yung\_awkward posted in Dec 2022 that the rug had something to ""do with the Whitehouse"" due to the symbols.

The scene is allegedly the ""level playing field"" but Brad has a card up his sleeve.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the fifth monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JUNE Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7.5 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** ***on the blog.***
* **MAY Highlights:** Another mostly green month; **ETH** has its best month of 2025. **BTC** in overall lead with **Tron** in second place, also the only two cryptos in the 2025 Experiment aren't underwater YTD (anyone predict this?).
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 8 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+265% vs S&P500's +63% - see below for details).

# Month Five – Down -13%

https://preview.redd.it/vi919nm1be7f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=411a7d22897f681d981dd8e3057e9d8cba0110e4

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

May highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Similar to April, lots of green
* **ETH** pops
* Only two cryptos are in positive territory YTD: **BTC** and **Tron** (how many guessed this correctly on January 1st?).

# May Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

Five months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# May Winners and Losers

https://preview.redd.it/0b44goq2be7f1.png?width=266&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa633625fb535258a03587d76002eccc467245da

  
Five months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** – For the first time in a long time, **ETH** (+36%) has a very good month. **BTC**, **Tron**, and **BNB** were each up about 10% as well.

***May Losers*** – **AVAX** lost ground compared to its peers this month, down -6% in May. 

# Overall Update: BTC maintains the lead, portfolio under water, most cryptos in negative territory, AVAX in last

Year to date **BTC** (+12%) maintains the lead with **Tron** (+5%) in second.  The rest are either flat or in the red and **AVAX** is the worst performer (-42%) YTD.

After a fairly good start (the portfolio was +7% in January), the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio is down -13%.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BTC** five months ago is worth $112 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio gained $45 in May, about the same it gained in April. The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$867**, still underwater for 2025, but moving in the right direction.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens like I do for my Experiments).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, five months later:

**May Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +5% 
* **COIN50**: +12%

The May monthly victory goes to: **COIN50** (its second monthly victory)

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -13%
* **COIN50**: -10%

Overall lead:  **COIN50**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +50% (total value $1,500)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +671% (total value $7,705)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +890% (total value $9,898) (***best performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +315% (total value $4,153)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -15% (total value $851) (***worst performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +168% (total value $2,676)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +54% (total value $1,535)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -13% (total value $867)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$29,186.**

https://preview.redd.it/jpk8ssihbe7f1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a9c3f4b134922f56f6212df2aacd5fcad6cbd3e

**That’s up +265%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was **November 2021’s all time high** of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/8mk8ua2kbe7f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c21d4e9337ac43d8224939b8490960486cfa55

In summary: ***That’s a +265% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is down -5% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $953 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,212 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,359 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,830 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,240 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,540 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,239 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,005 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,000.**

That is up **+63%** since January 2018 compared to a **+265%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.",69

XRP,2025-03-08,post,CryptoCurrency,Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. BULLISH!?!,"Well to start off, it's good news that the government can see Bitcoin as an asset to turn to. Although they are not at the phase of buying yet. It doesn't mean it will stay that way. As some others have said in the community, this will basically be a war of who has the most bitcoin and as we know, the U.S. wants to be the best at everything. So it makes sense why they won't just stick to only obtaining Bitcoin by criminal holdings. They'll have to buy to keep up. 

Unfortunately, ADA and XRP are not relevant but they were doing fine before today regardless. I'd say we have a good run coming along and either way this is SUPER bullish imho because we would've never thought the government would want to get involved with cryptocurrency but here we are. This is bullish for the whole crypto market and the patient ones have been rewarded. Sometimes you can't satisfy people no matter how much you give. (I'm talking to the people whining about the good news we had today)

Now what's your thoughts? What happens now? I'd like to know

My guess, overtime BTC will be accumulated by the government and may even push for more aggressive approaches to obtain more. They don't plan on selling either so the games as to who has the most Bitcoin became serious. This is going to be on a serious global scale between countries as to who can hold the most! We are going to struggle more than ever to obtaining as much Bitcoin as possible. It's not only Large intuitions against the people anymore, it will also be countries themselves. ",0

XRP,2025-03-08,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. BULLISH!?!...,"Honestly, the idea of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” sounds cool on paper, but let’s take a step back. Governments aren’t exactly rushing to hoard BTC the way gold has historically been stockpiled. The U.S. government already controls a significant amount of confiscated Bitcoin, and yet, instead of hoarding, it sells it off regularly. If they really saw BTC as a strategic reserve asset, they wouldn’t be auctioning it to the highest bidder every time they seize some.

But let’s put that aside and look at the bigger picture—crypto is stuck in neutral. Bitcoin is 15 years old, and outside of some scaling improvements (like Lightning), there hasn’t been any fundamental innovation in years. If this whole “BTC war between countries” narrative actually plays out, it won’t be because of any groundbreaking tech but just speculation and scarcity games—which, let’s be real, is not the same as meaningful technological progress.

And that’s the real issue: crypto has become stagnant. Ethereum’s last big move was The Merge in 2022, and while it made staking possible and reduced energy consumption, it didn’t make ETH fundamentally more useful. The same goes for every other major blockchain—most of them haven’t meaningfully changed in 2-4+ years. Solana? Still working out network stability issues. Cardano? Has been “building” forever, but where’s the real-world impact? Avalanche? Subnets sounded cool but haven’t really shifted the landscape.

Now, I know what people will say: “Regulation is holding innovation back!” But let’s be real. Regulatory uncertainty doesn’t stop developers from creating new technology—it just slows adoption. If crypto projects were truly pushing the boundaries of tech, we’d still see radical innovations regardless of regulations. AI, quantum computing, and biotech are all heavily regulated industries, but they’re still evolving at a breakneck pace. Meanwhile, crypto’s “innovation” for the last few years has mostly been yield farming, memecoins, and copy-paste NFT projects.

So while everyone is hyped about governments “accumulating BTC”, the real question should be: why has the entire crypto space been stuck in the same narrative for the last five years? BTC scarcity might create supply games, but where’s the next wave of technological breakthroughs? At this point, AI and quantum computing will probably make a bigger impact on finance before crypto does.",8

And a lot of Americans would probably love better access to/free healthcare but the govt doesn’t do that.

The same issues still have to be addressed but by these guys.  Starting with an audit and what's needed to be done to move custody/control from DoJ to Treasury. New laws/processes to be hammered out there.

Along with that rules for Treasury on what to hodl, what to sell. Creating a basket effectively, probably with some weighting mechanism and how that portfolio will be managed. Then what to do with the stuff not in the basket. 

And the matter of Stables backed by US$. Again more rules and things.

XRP,2025-03-04,post,CryptoCurrency,Do the price fluctuations this week matter in the long run?,"So I’m super new to crypto, like I just started last week. I’ve always wanted to but now that I’m old enough and finally have a decent amount of my own money, I thought I would put some money into crypto knowing nothing other than “Bitcoin is worth a lot”. 

So I’ve invested about 1,4K dollars spread over Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Algorand, HBAR, XRP, Shiba, Doge, Jupiter, with my highest monetary investment on ALG HBAR XRP SOL. 

Anyways, I invested a lot right before the surge on Sunday, and then didn’t sell because I thought it would keep going up. Then I bought some more when it dropped on Monday, but waking up today and I’m down around 200 dollars, since I bought a big chunk last night right before everything went down.

Disregarding how bad my strategy was and of course no one having the real answer, does it even matter if I bought when XRP, for example, was at 2,2 and now it going down? Selling now would be stupid right, as everything should rise in the long run?

I’m not sure if I should pull the plug on SOL and ETH and transfer during the dips now to others like XRP, since I’ve read around and that one seems most likely to explode.

I’m in it for the long run, however I have this tendency to keep checking changes and it’s making me crazy, especially when being down so much money already (haven’t sold anything yet).

Idk, just wanted to get the thoughts of some more experienced people. Maybe the question is dumb lol. Thx anyways!

JFC 🤦‍♂️

This isn’t smart investing bro. When investing a small amount like $1.4k, spreading it across too many assets is just going to dilute your potential gains and make it harder to see meaningful growth. If one of these coins takes off, the small allocation means your overall port won’t benefit significantly.

Yes, diversification is meant to reduce risk, but with a small portfolio, it mainly just limits upside. A large spread only makes sense when you’re managing a large sum, where protecting your capital is as important as growing it.

“The President definitely thinks that there’s a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” Secretary Lutnick told The Pavlovic Today. “Now there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies? And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.”

Lutnick suggested Bitcoin would receive unique status under Trump’s plans.

“A Bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President’s interested in. He spoke about it all during the campaign trail, and I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday,” Lutnick said.

“So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently—positively, but differently,” he added.”

XRP,2024-11-20,post,CryptoCurrency,Eventually everything will run through the Chainlink ecosystem,"Hear me out. 

Chainlink has spent the entirety of its life very steadily building. For a long time we thought it was only going to be a price oracle, then suddenly we discovered it was actually becoming a complete on-boarding powerhouse to connect everything to everything. 

Chainlink opened up the possibility for the entire blockchain space to easily, securely, and affordably interact with each other in very seamless ways. Prior to this, each blockchain was very segmented and it was such a pain (expensive too) in order to get assets bridged. There were also countless hacks that many projects struggled to survive.  

It also opened up Traditional finance to tokenize their assets, eliminate transaction errors, and instantly onboard their ledgers into the blockchain spaces all while moving to a 24/7 365 operating hours for transactions. This is going to not only make the traditional markets A LOT more money, but its going to save them rougjly 80 billion im errors a year. 

Chainlink ecosystem is rapidly growing faster than any other ecosystem I've seen. We're quickly seeing the entire blockchain and Traditional Finance space integrate  with Chainlink in order to keep up with the advancements they're making. 

Even projects who ARENT integrating Chainlink directly, are still integrating it throigh 3rd parties. 

For example, one of the very few projects that's trying to compete with Chainlink in the TradFi sector, is only able to do so by partnering with the company Axelar. 

Can you take a wild guess what Axelar uses in order to bring those functions to XRP? You guessed it Chainlink. 

Tldr; Chainlink is becoming the standard to link the world. Don't miss the boat ✌️ Don't let the FUD and misinformation about the project deter you from doing your own research.

**Green Pill** - https://pod.link/1609313639

A podcast by Kevin Owocki, focused entirely on public goods projects. Each episode he interviews someone building one of these types of use cases. There's an entire season about onchain identity, with all the projects you'd expect (Proof of Humanity, Idena, Bright ID etc) and plenty of episodes on democratic tools like quadratic voting. 

Just take a look through the back catalogue and you'll find loads to listen to.

You'll presumably guess from the title what sort of tech podcast is about! Hosted by Anna Rose, this is one to listen to if you want to be ahead of the curve in understanding where crypto is going. It's the technology behind ZK rollups (the most secure type of L2s) and an entire branch of the Ethereum L1 roadmap is dependent on it -  https://ethroadmap.com/verge.html

There's a couple of 'Introduction to ZK' episodes that are a good place to start if you are completely new. As well as the podcast they also host a conference, a community forum and a job board for if you really want to get involved!",5

1. Cutting-Edge Technology Stack
PAW Chain stands apart from other blockchains by leveraging a modern, multi-language technology stack that goes beyond the limitations of traditional blockchains that rely on Golang or Rust. The integration of Node.js for network operations and TypeScript for core blockchain logic offers unique advantages:

Asynchronous I/O with Node.js: This allows for efficient management of simultaneous connections, a crucial feature in blockchain environments where multiple transactions need to be processed at once. With Node.js, PAW Chain can optimize network layer performance, improving transaction speed and efficiency.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Node.js enables PAW Chain to operate across different operating systems, allowing a wider range of validators to participate. This is the first time in blockchain development that a validator node can be set up on any operating system, making the network more accessible and inclusive.

TypeScript Benefits: TypeScript provides enhanced code quality, scalability, maintainability, and early bug detection. These features are essential for the long-term success of blockchain applications, offering a more robust and scalable solution than traditional JavaScript libraries or even Golang.

2. PAW Chain’s Infinite Scalability Mechanism
PAW Chain introduces an innovative approach to block production and validator participation:

Real-Time Block Minting: Unlike traditional blockchains that mint blocks at fixed intervals (e.g., every second or every 15 seconds), PAW Chain mints blocks in real time. As soon as a transaction is received and validated, a block is created immediately. This real-time block production significantly reduces latency and ensures a seamless user experience.

Validator-Driven Block Size: As the number of validators increases, PAW Chain dynamically adjusts the size of each block. Initially, three validators sign each block, but as the network grows, this can increase to five, eight, or more, allowing the chain to process more transactions per block. This results in infinite scalability, ensuring that the network can handle an ever-growing volume of transactions without bottlenecks.

3. Cross-Chain and Interoperability Features
One of the most exciting aspects of PAW Chain is its seamless cross-chain functionality:

Universal Protocols and Bridges: PAW Chain employs a series of standardized communication protocols and unique bridges that allow dApps deployed on the chain to interact seamlessly with other blockchains, including Solana, Tron, and EVM chains. These bridges act as multi-signatory wallets, with validators confirming transactions on both sides, ensuring secure cross-chain asset transfers.

PAW Swap – Consolidated Liquidity: Unlike other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, which require separate instances and liquidity pools for each blockchain, PAW Swap operates with a single router contract and liquidity pool on PAW Chain. This revolutionary design allows liquidity to be accessed from all chains connected to PAW Chain, eliminating the need for fractured liquidity and minimizing price impact. As a result, projects can consolidate their liquidity on PAW Chain and benefit from improved trading efficiency.

4. Validator System and Incentive Structure
PAW Chain’s validator system is designed to ensure both security and inclusivity:

Validator Levels and Redundancy: PAW Chain employs a cross-stitching methodology that divides validators into three levels, each performing different tasks for block confirmation. This method prevents malicious behavior and ensures that each block is verified twice, significantly enhancing network security.

Flexible Staking Model: Validators can either fully self-stake the required 2.5 trillion PAW tokens or receive delegations through lockers. Partial stake validators, starting with 10% of the required stake, are placed in a pending pool until they receive enough delegations to meet the threshold. This flexibility allows more participants to become validators and contribute to the network’s decentralization.

Reward Distribution: Full-stake validators receive 90% of the block rewards, while delegators and partial-stake validators also share in the rewards. This incentivizes both validators and token holders to contribute to the network’s growth.

5. Node Allocation and Expansion
PAW Chain’s node allocation strategy ensures that the network remains secure and balanced as it grows:

Initial Cap and Gradual Expansion: The network begins with an initial cap of 12 nodes, consisting of both team and community nodes. As the network stabilizes, additional validator slots will be opened on a first-come, first-served basis, promoting further community participation.
6. Redis-Powered Blockchain Ledger
PAW Chain uses Redis data stores as its core blockchain ledger, a significant departure from traditional blockchain data storage methods. This architecture enables:

In-Memory Storage: The last five blocks are stored in memory, ensuring rapid access and quick confirmations, while older blocks are stored on HDDs for long-term storage.

Edge Routing for Low-Latency Validator Selection: PAW Chain employs edge routing to select validators with the lowest latency, further reducing response times and improving the user experience.

7. Long-Term Growth and Value Creation
One of the standout features of PAW Chain is that all its utilities can be accessed from any connected chain, without the need for redeployment. This means that soon dApps on PAW Chain will be directly accessible from at least 30 EVM chains, Solana, and Tron and eventually 100s of chains. Each utility generates fees for the PAW treasury, ensuring long-term value growth for the ecosystem.

Conclusion
PAW Chain represents a significant leap forward in blockchain technology, offering a mix of innovative features that address many of the limitations of current blockchain systems. With its real-time block minting, dynamic validator scaling, seamless cross-chain interaction, and flexible staking model, PAW Chain is well-positioned to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. Its modern technology stack, combined with Redis-powered data storage and edge routing, enables unparalleled scalability, security, and efficiency.

By consolidating liquidity, improving validator accessibility, and ensuring 100% interoperability across multiple blockchains, PAW Chain has the potential to become a leading solution in the next generation of blockchain platforms. The future of blockchain technology could very well be shaped by the innovations brought forth by PAW Chain.

XRP,2024-11-19,post,CryptoCurrency,Possible Collaboration of XRP & ADA?,"This is all just my speculation, here are some events which happened recently for ADA and XRP:

\-Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced plans to work with the incoming Trump administration to develop clear crypto regulations. 

\-Charles Hoskinson talked to the CEO of Ripple (Brad Garlinghouse), and it seems like they buried their beef. Also Charles was saying the CEO was ""extremly collaborative"" 

\-Now he had a talk with the Chief of Technology (CTO) of Ripple. Maybe they plan to collaborate and that's why he talked with the CTO of Ripple afterwards? 

\-Trump plans to remove capital gains tax from US cryptocurrencies (this would include XRP and ADA)

\- There is a rumor Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump

XRP,2025-05-14,post,CryptoCurrency,Is Cryptocurrency on Life Support? Examining the Cracks in the Digital Gold Rush,"The cryptocurrency market, once hailed as the future of finance, is showing alarming signs of systemic decay. While Bitcoin’s price hovers near $103,000 as of May 14, 2025 [18](https://coindcx.com/blog/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-weekly/), beneath the surface lies a landscape riddled with collapsing ecosystems, regulatory hostility, and evaporating innovation. Let’s dissect why the crypto dream might be unraveling.

# 1. The Great Contraction: Market Fundamentals Implode

The total crypto market cap sits at $3.09 trillion [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/), but this figure masks a brutal redistribution of wealth. Excluding Bitcoin, the altcoin market has cratered by **41% since December 2024**\-plummeting from $1.6 trillion to $950 billion [4](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/04/28/crypto-winter-at-the-door-analysis-of-the-second-quarter-2025/). Even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has erased all 2024 gains, nosediving from $3,336 to $1,805 in Q1 2025 [6](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/2025-q1-crypto-report).

**Why this matters:**

* Stablecoins now dominate trading volumes (Tether: $149B market cap [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/)), signaling investors are fleeing volatility rather than embracing it
* Venture capital funding has collapsed to 2017 levels [4](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/04/28/crypto-winter-at-the-door-analysis-of-the-second-quarter-2025/), starving projects of development resources
* Daily trading volumes fell 27.3% YoY to $146B in Q1 2025 [5](https://www.channelstv.com/2025/04/17/crypto-market-suffers-633-5b-loss-q1-2025/), indicating waning retail participation

# 2. Regulatory Noose Tightens

The SEC’s May 12 announcement of new crypto token rules [8](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-sec-chair-says-agency-plans-create-new-rules-crypto-tokens-2025-05-12/) epitomizes growing global hostility:

* Tokens deemed securities must register with strict disclosure requirements
* DeFi protocols face existential threat from IRS reporting mandates (only temporarily paused via H.J.Res.25 [3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cryptocurrency-market-synopsis-may-6-2025-nicole-herstik-qej2c))
* UK’s draft legislation imposes bank-level compliance on crypto firms [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/)

**Real-world impact:**

* Kraken cut 15% of staff (400 employees) ahead of IPO plans [7](https://www.reuters.com/technology/kraken-lays-off-hundreds-ahead-ipo-coindesk-reports-2025-04-17/)
* Developer activity hits **2018 lows** (3,500 monthly active developers vs. 9,000 in 2021 [9](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/crypto-developer-activity-hits-lowest-levels-since-2018))
* U.S. layoffs hit 105,441 in April 2025 alone [15](https://cn.blockchain.news/flashnews/us-layoffs-surge-to-105-441-in-april-2025-stock-market-volatility-and-crypto-market-impact-analysis), with crypto firms disproportionately affected

# 3. The Innovation Winter

Crypto’s core promise-disrupting traditional finance-has stalled:

* **DeFi TVL collapsed 27.5%** to $128.6B in Q1 2025 [6](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/2025-q1-crypto-report)
* NFT trading volumes evaporated, with top collections down 90%+ from 2022 peaks
* Memecoins now account for **39.6% of DEX trades** [6](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/2025-q1-crypto-report), reducing the market to speculative gambling

Even Bitcoin’s ""digital gold"" narrative is fracturing. While BTC gained 15% in April 2025 [10](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025-2026-2030-experts-btc-forecast-and-outlook-may-2025/), it underperformed gold (+18%) and U.S. Treasuries during Q1’s market turmoil [5](https://www.channelstv.com/2025/04/17/crypto-market-suffers-633-5b-loss-q1-2025/). Institutional inflows via ETFs (often cited as bullish) primarily benefit centralized custodians-not decentralized networks.

# 4. The Institutional Retreat

Wall Street’s crypto flirtation is cooling rapidly:

* Coinbase’s Q1 2025 report warns of ""crypto winter"" signals [17](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-institutional-says-several-signs-140101340.html)
* MicroStrategy’s BTC holdings are underwater after Q1’s 11.8% price drop [6](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/2025-q1-crypto-report)
* BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw **$1.2B in outflows** during April’s tariff uncertainty [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/)

The math is unforgiving:

* Bitcoin’s annualized volatility remains **82%** vs. gold’s 15% [10](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025-2026-2030-experts-btc-forecast-and-outlook-may-2025/)
* Energy consumption per BTC transaction equals 650,000 Visa payments [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/)
* 65% of Americans view crypto as ""too risky"" for retirement savings [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/)

# 5. The Ghost Chain Epidemic

A 2025 study reveals:

* 94% of altcoins launched since 2021 have <$10K daily volume
* 81% of ERC-20 tokens are effectively abandoned
* Solana’s 39.6% DEX trade dominance [6](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/2025-q1-crypto-report) comes entirely from memecoin pumps

Even ""blue chips"" aren’t safe:

* XRP’s 324% YTD gain [2](https://www.studyiq.com/articles/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-the-world/) stems from speculative hype, not utility (Ripple handles <0.01% of global cross-border payments)
* Cardano’s ADA has bled 60% of its value since 2024 highs despite ""groundbreaking"" research

# Conclusion: Dead or Comatose?

While Bitcoin may linger as a volatility play for traders, the broader crypto experiment appears mortally wounded. With developer exodus, regulatory assaults, and failed adoption metrics, the industry is repeating the dot-com bust’s trajectory-but without producing an Amazon or Google.

**The fatal contradiction:** Crypto’s survival now depends on the traditional financial system it vowed to replace. ETFs, banking partnerships, and compliance teams have neutered its revolutionary potential. When even maximalists celebrate Wall Street’s embrace, the decentralization dream is dead.

*What’s left?* A market propped up by memes, leverage, and the greater fool theory. The 2025 ""bull run"" looks increasingly like a dead-cat bounce-a final gasp before the crypto winter becomes an ice age.

Certainly. Here's a contradiction to that perspective, using the same tone and depth:

---

**Crypto in 2025: Not Dying—Evolving**

While alarmist takes proclaim the crypto market is imploding, the reality is more nuanced. Yes, the ecosystem is undergoing seismic shifts—but rather than signaling collapse, these are signs of maturation. The market is consolidating, regulatory frameworks are catching up, and speculative froth is being cleared. Let’s dissect why crypto is *evolving*, not unraveling.

---

### 1. **The Market is Not Imploding—It’s Rebalancing**

The altcoin market correction is a healthy sign of capital reallocating toward utility and sustainability. Bitcoin holding above \$103,000 and the total market cap at \$3.09T shows enduring interest—not decay.

**Context matters:**

* **Bitcoin ETF adoption** is driving institutional inflows, legitimizing the asset class and attracting regulated capital.
* **Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake** and Layer 2 expansion (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) are setting the groundwork for scalable dApps—temporary price corrections do not equal failed fundamentals.
* **Tether’s dominance** reflects growing use in global settlements and cross-border commerce—not fear. In emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey, USDT is a lifeline.

---

### 2. **Regulation = Legitimization**

New SEC rules and international frameworks are not ""hostile""—they’re long-overdue clarity. Mature markets need rules, not chaos.

* The UK’s proposed regulations offer *a pathway to full integration* with traditional finance.
* SEC registration requirements are creating a filter to eliminate frauds, not block innovation.
* Institutional layoffs are cyclical and *not exclusive to crypto*—the entire tech sector has seen contractions due to broader macro pressures.

Regulatory alignment with traditional finance isn't crypto's demise—it's crypto’s entrance into the global economic system.

---

### 3. **Innovation is Shifting Gears, Not Freezing**

The NFT hype dying down and memecoins surging are temporary noise. Underneath, **real tech is being built**:

* **DeFi** is evolving into RealFi (real-world finance), with tokenized U.S. treasuries, RWAs (Real World Assets), and stable yield products.
* **Base, Linea, and zkSync** show explosive L2 growth with developer and user activity moving off L1s.
* **Ethereum restaking** and modular blockchains like Celestia represent the next phase of experimentation.

Yes, memecoins exist—but so did Pets.com in the dot-com era. Amazon was also there, quietly building.

---

### 4. **Institutional Adoption Is Strategically Paused, Not Reversed**

Wall Street isn’t ""retreating""—they’re *realigning*.

* BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton now offer *crypto-native yield products and tokenized funds*.
* Coinbase remains the dominant U.S. on-ramp and custodian for institutional flows, with strong Q1 revenues.
* MicroStrategy is buying dips—again—and still outperforming the S\&P 500 over a 5-year horizon.

Short-term volatility is being mistaken for long-term disinterest. But smart money is still in the game—just more selectively.

---

### 5. **Ghost Chains Are a Filter, Not a Flaw**

Yes, 94% of altcoins have < \$10K daily volume—because **open ecosystems allow experimentation**. That’s a feature, not a bug.

* Solana’s memecoin surge has ironically **revitalized its ecosystem**, bringing unprecedented retail engagement and developer experimentation.
* Projects like Helium, Render, and Chainlink are building real-world integrations in telecom, AI compute, and data oracles.

Failure in Web3 isn't a crisis—it's a necessary component of permissionless innovation.

---

### Conclusion: Crypto Is Growing Up

Crypto is not dead, comatose, or collapsing. It’s maturing. The wild west days are giving way to structured growth, better regulation, and serious use cases.

The real contradiction lies in critics bemoaning crypto’s adoption by institutions and regulators while demanding mainstream acceptance. You can’t have it both ways.

**Crypto isn’t rejecting the financial system—it’s upgrading it from within.** The so-called ""bull run"" isn’t a dead-cat bounce; it’s the groundwork for a more resilient, globally integrated digital economy.

XRP,2024-12-10,post,CryptoCurrency,People like to bash memecoins but what do top 100 coins do?,"Ive been on and off in crypto since 2017, people kept blabbering about coin has to has utility and good team and so on for it to succeed but its been proven time and time again utility does not matter, all that matters is if a coin garners attention and the devs are active in promoting it and all the cases of a crypto being successful is a case of supply and demand.

I was in a crypto facebook group back in 2017 that could not shut up about serious coins destined to be successful because of their utility and whatever whitepaper they have, most of which are dead now, anyone remmeber in 2021 or whenever that was when cryptos with NFT utility was the “next big thing” coins that now lost 90% of their value.

So i do not understand the hate on memecoins, anyone experienced with crypto know 99% of coins created on pumpfun are rugpulls because of how easy it is to create a coin, but the age of serious coins and convincing people through usefulness and utility is over because lets face it crypto is never gonna be used in the real world as proven time and time again, the most that happens is some random cruiseship or a grocery store in thailand starts accepting bitcoin every bullrun.


The only thing that gives crypto any value is the demand for it and memecoins are where all the demand is nowadays, the only real reason to put ur money in any established coin with a huge market cap is for safety reasons, like protecting your assets behind a transparent team while experiencing some growths, the only reason some of the top coins are still alive is because theyre popular and old, some newcommers genuinely believe things like XRP can hit 1k lmao, speaking of XRP tell me one good reason XRP is the top 4 coin by market cap, it has been dead for years, the only coin i can think of that has real utility is monero for drug dealers on dark web.

If youre trying to make real money in crypto right now your only option is risking it on memecoins, being award of the rugpulls and still trying to get a lick, following trends, trends like spotify wrapped that only last one day or things christmas themed that last a season of if youre lucky a community driven coin like snakewifhat that work together to build something and try to make money together.

My point is lets not pretend most people care about a “project” all they care about is making money and memecoin communities are toxic and scammy but theyre transparent about one thing, a common interest in making money together, we are the fast age, crypto follows trends now and memecoins offer a way for trends to be capitalized, literally any event or meme or word thats happening is becoming a coin, you just have to know how to follow those trends and be smart to make money.




TLDR: basically the age of serious projects is over and boring, crypto has transformed in the last couple of years and is now and always has been only a volatile risky investment, a mean to make it big or lose, so lets not pretend not everyone here is not just trying to make money, because crypto is useless and inefficient in the real world.

XRP,2024-12-02,post,CryptoCurrency,Market Cap Explanation Needed,"Can someone please explain market cap? As usual during bull runs, we're seeing wild claims of xxxxxxcoin going 100x anytime soon. A friend of mine is convinced that XRP will surpass BTC this cycle based on what he's seen on tiktok. I don't even believe that's possible relative to market capacity. But I may have an incorrect understanding of market cap. My rational is that BTC with a market cap of $1.9T is 11x the market cap of XRP ($161B). IF (and I still don't believe that it's possible) XRP reaches $1.9T in market cap, would that mean that it's current price would only 11x to about $30 per coin?

Your math is right. There are far more XRP than BTC.  There are 21M BTC and 57B (billion) XRP.

So BTC and XRP having the same collective value (market cap) would result in a per coin price of XRP which is 1/2,700th of BTC per coin price.  Alternatively $1.9T = $1,900B / 57B coins = $33.33 price per XRP.

So if your friend thinks that the market cap of XRP can match BTC well that is very dubious but not impossible. However if he thinks the price per coin of XRP can exceed the price per coin of BTC that is just asinine.  With 57B coins a price per coin of ~$90k would mean a market cap of $5,130T or five quadrillion dollars.   That is roughly 10x the net value of all the wealth in all forms on the planet combined (all real estate, all land, all stocks, all bonds, all other crypto, all precious metals, all currency, all mineral rights, all royalties, all art, all person property, etc).  The net value of all wealth on earth in all forms owned by all people collectively is roughly $450T.

Now someone will say there is no upper limit and if there is enough demand then price and thus market cap could rise to any number.  In theory that is true, it is just supply and demand but the supply is massive and for there to be enough demand to support a valuation which exceeds all other wealth on the planet by an order of magnitude is implausible.",31
XRP,2024-12-02,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Market Cap Explanation Needed...,"Imagine you have a sketch you made when you were six years old.

You cut it up into 100 pieces of paper.

You then sell one of those pieces of paper for $1.

Your sketch now has a ""market cap"" of $100 because that one piece you sold for $1 establishes a price for how much a ""piece"" of your sketch is worth.

That's basically how market cap works. Except instead of pieces of paper, crypto uses coins/tokens while companies use stock shares.

So when they say Apple's stock is worth $240 per share, to get the market cap you need to figure out how many shares Apple is made of. Right now, there are about 15 billion shares of Apple, so Apple's market cap is $240 x 15 billion, or $3.6 trillion.

>A friend of mine is convinced that XRP will surpass BTC this cycle based on what he's seen on tiktok

Your friend is an idiot for listening to financial info on TikTok.

Writing this, my math doesn't seem right. Can someone please explain?

Yes, that's correct.

That said, market cap and coin price are not the be all end all of valuing these things. Liquidity is perhaps more important. A coin or token with low liquidity can have massive spikes in ""value"", which leads to momentarily high market cap, but as soon as anyone tries to sell, that market cap will collapse because no one actually wants to buy it at that price.

Also, in case anyone is wondering, BTC's market cap is less than 5% that of the S&P 500.",11

That doesn't mean 1 trillion dollars got invested in it since so many people would have bought at a much, much lower price.

XRP,2024-12-02,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Market Cap Explanation Needed...,"Its just the ratio of the last accepted market value of a coin to its circulating supply. It is useful for comparing the ‘expensiveness’ of one crypto to another with their differing circulating supplies taken out of the equation.  

If crypto A has a market cap of 80 billion and crypto B has that of 10 billion, then crypto A is 8x more expensive **relative to its supply** than crypto B, based on the **most recent market value of A**. If crypto B is suddenly sold for 8x more than its most recent price, then that is now the most recent market value of it, and its now equally as expensive as crypto A relative to its own supply. 

You can see market cap isnt really as useful as its made out to be. It assumes that the circulating supply is accurate, and that the most recent market value of a crypto is widely accepted. 

If those assumptions hold true, then you can use it to compare how expensive one thing is relative to another, and thats about all. It says nothing about how healthy a project is, future growth, etc.",2

If you have a project with 1 trillion coins and someone buys a single coin at $1, Market Cap is $1T. If you have a project with 20MM coins and someone buys at $100k, Market Cap is at 2T. 


It is not the sum value of all money in a project. Just what someone is willing to pay times the circulating supply.



In traditional stock investing you can compare that to other company details like P/E, profit per share, etc. to get a better understanding of value and company health. 


In crypto, not so much. 


It really is just most recent sale price times circulating supply based on what someone is presently willing to pay.


Still, high MC has optics because people compare to the stock market. Likewise, total circulation is important because 20MM vs 55B coins means there is a lot of potential sales that could circulate and influence price long term. ",1

Hello everyone!

While not new to crypto, this is the first time I actually have money to invest into it and enough to make a real change in my life (without relying on moon meme luck).

But this poses its own issues, now I just want to buy every coin I see and hear about, and it's getting out of hand, right now I'm at 22 coins in my main portfolio (I have another meme one for gambling, only 5 coins), and there are a few extra coins I would like to get, but I think it's becoming too much and I wanted to listen to people here with more experience.

With this portfolio, I'm looking at 5-10x, which I don't think it's crazy (Is it? Is it too low?)

At the moment, I don't really have an exit plan other than start taking 25% out each month, once I start hearing about crypto from my aunts and the Uber driver, or when JPEGs are selling for the price of a super car.

Anyway, as you can seem I'm heavy on DePin/Ai, with some crypto gaming in there. I also know that XRP is a controversial subject, but it's the one project I'm solid on, so not looking for get rid of that one or HBAR. Anything else, I'm open to suggestions.

My dumbass lost $150 and I'm with $100 left, i keep investing in coins that see gains at the moment but as soon as i invest boom they crash down and i end up withdrawing at a loss, i keep looking at top gainers and i have no idea what to do, invest in XRP? DOGE? AVAX? PEPE? another random meme coin? BTC? ETH? HBAR? How can i know which coins will suddenly gain big value gains? (Like PNUT and FARM) What are some indications for when a coin is about to have gains?

It will lower your average cost down. Most investors don’t make money over night. The PNUT story you read about is not common. It was also bought on an exchange you probably don’t even know how to use or find. Which is ok. Ever heard of a stop loss order? Stop limit order? I was just like you when I first started. FOMO(fear of missing out)  got me just like it gets a lot of people. Over time I educated my self and I learned more through trial and error and tons of research. I still have no idea what I’m doing. But I’m more educated and able to make decisions not based on emotion. 

Been buying a certain coin since 2020. When I bought I was uneducated and it was pretty much bought at its ATH. Kept going down for years and I continued to buy more which is called DCA and I lowered my average cost by a significant amount. And because I did my research.  Now that particular coin is doing well and I’m making significant gains.

XRP,2025-07-15,post,CryptoCurrency,The Quiet Rise of XRPL Memecoins as Alt Season Begins,"It looks like the alt season is finally beginning to take shape. While the market sentiment has been gradually improving, many investors are starting to look beyond the major coins to explore new opportunities.

One area worth considering is memecoins on the XRPL. The XRP Ledger has become a surprisingly vibrant environment for emerging tokens, offering fast and inexpensive transactions compared to many other networks.

For those who enjoy trading in a more automated way, there is even a new tool similar to the Bonk Bot on Telegram. It’s called the PHNIX Bot, and it provides the same convenient trading experience but specifically for XRPL tokens.

It might be a good moment to do some research and see whether these smaller, community-driven coins could play a part in your portfolio. As always, it’s important to stay cautious, but sometimes the biggest opportunities appear when most people are still watching from the sidelines.",0

XRP,2025-01-31,post,CryptoCurrency,Buying alt coins that have vanished,"Hi accountants, we can get tax deductions on our loses. After making profits in this cycle I want to sell or offset my loses by selling coins that went to zero in 2017. Literally $2000 down to $0.

But we can't sell, we have the coins in the wallet but coin has rugged and disappeared from this planet.

This coin has disappeared so how can we get a tax deduction with it? including the exchange saying you can't sell your tokens try transfering to another wallet. If I transfer to another wallet that doesn't do anything as coins are no longer in existence. The project is deleted.

Can we burn the coin or put in a fake address that goes to thin air in this case we can have a so called sell invoice to claim on tax?

Or is a screenshot of the value good enough for tax? Baught $2000 in 2017 - current wallet value $0 in 2025.

Thanks in advance.

(Offset my 2017 losses for this years profits to benifit tax.)

Edit: thanks for your comments.

I've emailed the exchange and they emailed me a receipt with 33cents lol, and removed the coins from my account with no fees. It's a win, it was worth zero on my side. Easy tax deduction on the zillion I made and will make this cycle. A few years ago they weren't this helpful which I was surprised they did it so easily this time, literally not even 15 minutes.

If an asset becomes worthless and you can’t sell it, some tax authorities allow you to claim it as an abandoned asset. Proof might include exchange delisting notices, blockchain records showing inactivity, and any official communication from the project confirming its demise.

Some people send coins to an unrecoverable address (e.g., a known burn address) as proof of disposal. However, the IRS might not always recognize this as a valid sale.",2

XRP,2025-03-27,post,CryptoCurrency,Investment in Crypto Currency -,"Im building a portfolio of high-utility, scalable cryptocurrencies that I believe have strong real-world use cases, active development communities, and long-term growth potential.

 I've chosen coins like XRP, HBAR, VET, ALGO, MATIC, DOT, ADA, and ICP because they play a key role in the future of decentralised finance, cross-border payments, enterprise adoption, and blockchain infrastructure. My strategy is to buy low now, while many of these assets are still undervalued, and hold long-term.

 If even a few of these coins reach my target of £1,000 to £1,500 per coin over the next 5 to 10 years, the returns could be life-changing — for example, owning just 100 coins could be worth £100,000 to £150,000, while 500 coins could be worth between £500,000 and £750,000. I'm investing based on conviction in utility and future adoption, not hype.

My Investment would be around £4100 today 

Thoughts and comments welcome - even if you don't believe :) - just need one coin to do it.

I follow some profiles on X/twitter, and I think I have weeded out some of the noise on there, but some recommendations for legit accounts would be nice.

I've just entered the world of cryptocurrencies and I'm fascinated. I've seen my money yield amounts that are already significant to me, but when I look at the historical charts, I notice that everything has been quite stable since I joined, fluctuating at the same level, and that there have been much more considerable highs and lows in the past. I've studied a fair bit, and I know I'm a complete amateur, but I bought 200 dollars worth of each of the following coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Polkadot, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche. I know it is not that much and I'll keep investing. I don’t need short-term profit and I’m saving and setting goals. Now, I’m completely lost, because I imagine we’re in a moment of sideways movement, and in the last two days my coins have gone up quite a bit, but I saw that it’s nothing compared to what can actually happen. I see people saying we’re about to have an alt season, others saying we’re in a bear trap and Bitcoin is going to rise more, and some saying it’s going to keep moving sideways... Is this uncertainty always part of the crypto market, or are there trends that always repeat? What do you think is going on right now?

XRP,2025-04-02,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Advice for a newbie?...,"A farm is where the token has very tight supply control among a few whales, so they can coordinate and collude to slowly bleed the token down. That way, they can manipulate the charts and exit at the highest possible price. The term originates from MMO, where players optimize their gameplay routine to maximize rewards.

You can tell it is a farm by 1) how slowly it bleeds over time and 2) how it moves in a tight range.

If you look at the rest of the crypto market, corrections happen rapidly and sharply. Why? When the supply is not in whales' tight control, it falls into the hands of many leveraged traders and inexperienced investors. So when panic sets in, all these traders and paper hands just relentlessly dump. So you usually see chaos in the chart when ppl exit, you don't see a slow and orderly exit. A farm does the opposite, the exit happens slowly and range bounds.

Another feature of a farm is how it is rapidly sold off when it reaches a certain high value. That is when whales are offloading.

Now go look at XRP's chart. See how it maintains its downward Bart trajectory.",2

XRP,2025-06-28,post,CryptoCurrency,Ripple ceo says they will drop appeal which should end the case,"Ceo of ripple posted on x they were dropping their cross appeal and sec expected to do the same which would mean the ever lasting case finally wraps up 100%.

If anyone was wondering why the price action for xrp was looking better than most at the minute. Nb the xrp element of case was already ruled on not being in and of itself not a security, but it staying open always felt like it still held price back a bit.

Unless I’ve missed something this would be the last case the sec had open against crypto. The end of an era started by clayton on his last day in office and dragged on thru the gensler years.

Pepperidge farm remembers the years prior to this when ripple would be heckled for “working with the man”, it’s been a testing time but even if you’re not a fan you have to respect the way ripple were prepared to stand up for the industry and fight the “jackbooted thugs” to counter the previous view.

Cost them over $100mn in legal fees and xrp missed the last bull run because of it in my opinion but hopefully the future is brighter",7

XRP,2025-06-27,post,CryptoCurrency,Users with a minimum $100-equivalent Balance on any of 8 major Blockchain Networks (during the snapshot on June 11 00:00 UTC) are eligible for Cardano's Midnight Glacier Airdrop,"The Midnight network is distributing its NIGHT tokens through a multi-phase distribution process, aiming to empower a diverse community. The NIGHT token is used to generate DUST, a shielded network resource that powers transactions, promoting sustainable operations and enabling free transactions for holders who generate enough DUST. The process consists of three Claim phases and a Redemption period, where eligible participants can claim token allocations without purchase. The token supply will be allocated as follows:

**Claim Phase 1: Glacier Drop**

* 50% to ADA holders
* 20% to BTC holders
* 30% split among holders of ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, AVAX, and BAT, in proportion to their relative USD value

**Claim Phase 2: Scavenger Mine**

100% of unclaimed tokens from the Glacier Drop phase will be:

* Distributed among participants
* Allocated to core network constituents (Midnight Foundation, Midnight TGE, Reserve, and on-chain Treasury)
* Carried over to the next claim phase (Lost-and-Found)

**Claim Phase 3: Lost-and-Found**

In the Lost-and-Found phase, eligible individuals who missed the Glacier Drop claim phase can claim a fraction of their original token entitlements from the remaining tokens in the Lost-and-Found pool.

XRP,2025-06-27,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Users with a minimum $100-equivalent Balance on an...,"I like the inclusivity, but I feel like they weren't intentional enough about the distribution of the Glacier Drop. You want a wide distribution, but you also don't want it so wide that users get allocations so small that they don't care about it or sell it immediately and $100 is only .001 BTC and there are 10,000,000 addresses with that much and probably millions more on the other networks. It's also not clear if they did any sort of sybil detection, or allocation adjustments. Is someone that splits their holdings into X number of wallets going to get that much more than someone with a single eligible wallet? Is a BTC millionaire getting the same as someone with only $100 in BTC?

Also, seems a little odd that they would allocate only the unclaimed tokens to things like the foundation and reserve. Because typically you want everyone claiming their airdrops, but if everyone does that here, it would leave literally nothing. And it's also pretty ambiguous about which  unclaimed tokens would go to Scavenger Mine and which would carry over to the Lost and Found. I'm not suggesting they did this, but making such wide eligibility makes it really easy for a lot of the tokens to be left unclaimed and for them to retain a larger part of the supply. It seems charitable to do it this way, giving potentially 100% away, but in reality I bet the percentage is far smaller.",5

There are a few projects being able to connect to the existing networks (banks etc.). They are commonly referred as the ISO coins. This is about ISO 20022 and TC307 and TC68 and XML/JSON messages and SWIFT and many other very technical compliances and standards that are too techy for me as well.

If you take a closer look at HBAR XRP XLM ALGO LINK XDC and QNT (you may also add CSPR, DAG, IOTA and LCX but I'm a bit cautious about them for different reasons) you see very similar patterns not caused by drops in BTC dominance. The patterns look like whale actions - insiders. Consider yourself lucky to be reading this right now because this is a gold mine and I'm already at about +400%. No financial advice though!

So those bad boys are taking roles in the new financial world. Some do big money (XRP), some will do retail money (XLM), some will interconnect specific regions and networks using interoperability tools (QNT), some will enhance the current outdated SWIFT network (LINK), some will take roles in Trade Finance (XDC - wow, that surge yesterday... @\_@), some will do supply chain. CSPR is actually even taking part in creating the details of these standards (watch video below about CSPR). HBAR is touching nearly all of these fields as you know.

They all have in common that they are sitting together with the current leaders of fintech, TradFi, enterprises, banks, even governments. It's basically a exclusive club and the net worth of the assets involved... well. Basically most of the money on earth. I know it sounds crazy but you do realize that even Blackrock already has its hands in this jar?

**If this is such an important thing, then why are so few projects interested in being compliant? Shouldn't we see most L1's and DeFi protocols making a big push for compliance?** The March deadline is fast approaching but even the coins that currently have compliance don't make a big deal about it... **Why aren't the ISO20022 compliant coins touting the compliance?** If any project should understand the gravity of this, it's those ones.

>If you take a closer look at HBAR XRP XLM ALGO LINK XDC and QNT (you may also add CSPR, DAG, IOTA and LCX but I'm a bit cautious about them for different reasons) you see very similar patterns not caused by drops in BTC dominance. The patterns look like whale actions - insiders.

Yeah you absolutely do not know that this is insiders. Every coin you listed has strong retail interest and only recently have a few of them had institutional interest. Very easily could've been from any group. **What proof do you have that this is insiders?**

Although this is the one thing that might actually have substance, the idea that even if ISO20022 doesn't matter, enough people think it does to move the markets on those coins.

>So those bad boys are taking roles in the new financial world.

Pure hopium. Only Ripple even makes note of the fact that they are compliant and they did it almost 5 years ago. **Where is there any proof or even a good thesis that these will happen?**

>They all have in common that they are sitting together with the current leaders of fintech, TradFi, enterprises, banks, even governments. It's basically a exclusive club and the net worth of the assets involved... well.

Nothing exclusive about a messaging standard that anyone can apply to. **What have you seen that would make you think it's an exclusive club?**

Its basically a hidden IPO where these foundations and companies have an insane amount of money only because people bought the coin which at this point acts as company liquidity (stock). Company is basically spending users funds to do their bidding, pay for their every day business, salaries, shows etc. 

So it has many links to cults regarding the way things are funded and money spent. 

Ripple seems like one of the worst offenders since they acquired shitloads of stuff..everything is ""NDA*, half hidden, hinted and between the lines and users have no saying in anything.

CIRCLE built a really useful product. We can say what we want but if you look at it they have the biggest bridging currency that is used in so many platforms and chains. With some new changes in regulations it will probably start showing up more and more as a paying option in most of the places.

Claver suggested that XRP is a prime beneficiary of this covert activity. In his view, pending regulatory clarity and enterprise-level adoption could coincide with dwindling float, leading to an abrupt repricing. “At a certain point, demand on public exchanges will explode past supply — and that’s when the market will panic to reprice itself.

XRP,2025-03-23,post,CryptoCurrency,Consolidation,"Alright, if you’re keeping tabs on the charts, you’ve clocked it already: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP—the top three—are all in consolidation, trading flat in tight ranges. No breakout, no breakdown, just sideways action. You know the drill, but let’s unpack why it’s happening and what’s next.

This consolidation screams indecision. The market’s basically paused, with traders sitting on their hands. Macro’s a big driver here—interest rate hikes, inflation still lingering, and the Fed’s next move hanging over everything like a cloud. Regulatory noise isn’t helping either; XRP’s still got that SEC/Ripple saga dragging on, and any ruling could flip its script fast. Meanwhile, BTC and ETH aren’t immune—global uncertainty’s keeping everyone cautious.

But it’s not just the outside noise. We’ve got on-chain and ecosystem factors simmering too. Bitcoin’s halving is creeping closer, and you know how that tightens supply and sparks FOMO. Ethereum’s post-Merge upgrades are still settling in, with staking dynamics shifting the game. XRP’s banking on its cross-border niche, but adoption’s a slow burn. The market’s waiting for one of these to light the fuse.

You’ve seen this pattern before—consolidation’s the calm before the storm. Bollinger Bands are probably squeezing, RSI’s neutral, and volume’s drying up. It’s textbook coiling. When it snaps, we’ll get a breakout—could be a bullish run if sentiment flips green, or a bleed-out if support cracks. Check the 50-day MA and key levels; they’ll tell you where it’s leaning.

So, while it’s quiet, don’t zone out. Watch the catalysts—macro data drops, XRP court updates, or a whale move. This range won’t hold forever; the next shift’s coming, and you’ll want to be positioned when it hits.",0

XRP,2025-03-23,comment,CryptoCurrency,Comment on: Consolidation...,"Gold is often considered by many investors to be a flight to safety, as in a key RISK OFF asset. That doesn't mean that gold cannot be the precursor to crypto flipping to a bull market again, but honestly, what happened with gold was likely because the US was buying back into its reserves, and there was an enormous run on gold during January, and that's precisely when the USA was buying and loading up on it. January saw the biggest volume of gold purchase in several years. With the gold price now teetering on a very high revaluation, it makes sense to believe that gold could also be considered a RISK OFF asset. Gold often revalues much higher in inflationary environments, such as the one we are in. No one can deny that inflation has been the theme in play for a while now. Gold is perhaps reflecting the need for a store of value and to preserve investment capital during both RISK ON and RISK OFF environments. We are clearly in a RISK OFF environment, so gold can serve to preserve capital in both cases.",3

1. **Data Sources**: The table combines data from CoinMarketCap , Forbes , and SlickCharts . Some figures are approximate due to variations in reporting.
2. **BNB Exception**: BNB’s circulating supply decreased due to token burns by Binance .
3. **Stablecoins (USDT, USDC)**: Significant increases reflect growing demand for stablecoins in trading and DeFi .
4. **Ethereum**: Minimal supply growth post-merge to proof-of-stake, reducing issuance .
5. **Solana/Toncoin**: High increases due to ecosystem expansions and staking rewards .

XRP,2024-12-06,post,Ripple,Xrp not dropping in price when the bull market is over...?,"Like the other coins will..

I've heard quite a few people say this and I find it hard to believe.

At the moment, my mindset is sell xrp as close to the top as possible during the bull run and buy back in as close to the bottom of the bear market, to me this seems to most intelligent option.

I have a slight nagging doubt, maybe I've watched too much xrp vale, but could xrp really just keep going and going and never crash.

I have a fear of selling xrp around $15 and xrp hitting $10,000 a coin a year later.

Just wondering, any thoughts on this scenario.",63
XRP,2024-12-06,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Xrp not dropping in price when the bull market is ...,"Ideally everyone wants to sell as close to the top as possible, but the question is; when is the top? It's next to impossible to tell in the moment. Only in hindsight.

However, I must say, to think the price won't drop while everything else does is just as bad as saying you'll think we'll moon or think we'll drop < $1. To speak anything with such conviction in this space shows how ignorant one is.

From what I've gathered, it seems the best approach is a completely unemotional and systematic one. Put in place an algorithm or set of conditions that will enable you to sell or buy. You will likely never hit a top or bottom, but you will be realizing value. This is 99% ahead of everyone in the space, even myself. I struggle with selling due to tax implications, and yes, the very fact that I am greedy. This is despite no matter how much research I do. But I feel I am getting there.",49
XRP,2024-12-06,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Xrp not dropping in price when the bull market is ...,"A lot of us feel the same way. Sell some hold the rest? Sell all buy back in? The dilemma as you say is what if it doesn’t crash or drop much. Make a plan and make secondary plans if things change. I have been accumulating 4 years now. Sell some early for bills, a loan and college funds. Sell a bit higher to pad my fidelity account and change my life a decent amount. After that keep selling step by step as it goes up. I’m looking at ranges of $5-$13 to stay realistic (hopefully being realistic). I want to take enough out early to be satisfied with the effort I have put in to get here since we have no idea if $5 will be the max or $8 or what. I don’t want to bag hold 4 more years completely. I plan to hold onto some forever no matter what - at least what I have still in short term capital gains. BUT, if the price does go to the stars like $15-27 then I will probably go all out and see if I can or want to buy back in or just be happy with my life change. Of note, I am 52 years old. It’s kind of getting towards now or never to slow down working my ass off and overtime (to buy XRP). I don’t have a lot of cycles left in me. So anyway make a plan but have multiple other plans depending on what happens. Keep in mind no matter what you do, you won’t do it right or anywhere close to perfect. The goal is not perfect, the goal is come out alive. No matter how you do it you will have regrets so just accept this fact.

XRP,2024-12-12,post,Ripple,How will RLUSD affect the price of XRP?,Let me first start off by saying I hold XRP and im bullish on XRP. This post is not meant to be FUD its just to further my understanding. I understand that RLUSD is meant to be a stable coin which it backed by USD. Im just wondering how the XRP token is tied into all this? If its the Ripple Ledger or blockchain please explain how so. Thanks. ,127
XRP,2024-12-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: How will RLUSD affect the price of XRP?...,"I think we’re all in the same boat as far as no one really knows what will happen when RLUSD is launched. The one thing we do know is anything on the xrpl runs on xrp, meaning every transaction will burn xrp in the background

As far as price appreciation your guess is as good as mine brotha. I personally think xrp can reach $10, $100, $500 and long term $1k if everything aligns for ripple and xrp, but I’m hesitant to say RLUSD will boost the price instantly, or significantly solely off of usage. I could be, and hope I’m wrong. That would be a great suprise

What it will do however, is probably the most important thing for any long term play with a company like ripple, it adds credibility. Credibility is the #1 asset a company can have, especially one starting out like ripple. RLUSD adds to its product line, and will be the most compliant, transparent, and reliable stable coin on the market. Massive. It also opens the doors to institutions that are looking for an introductory solution in the space, without having to switch completely over to xrp before they know it’s the right move for them

If it can outperform circle, and eventually tether (which is known for not being very transparent and has issues with the government as of now) it secures ripple as the #1 crypto company on the globe for payment solutions, drastically improving the possibility for success of their IPO

Lastly, tether netted $6.2B in profit for 2023. That is huge. Imagine ripple netting half of that. 3/4. All of it. More. That would enable more acquisitions, more partnerships, more products, more marketing, more innovation, way more bottom line which equals more strength. Imagine this happening after IPO and when they have shareholder meetings they can announce these things. What about buybacks with revenue? Burns? It opens the door to what we want. Mass adoption. Best of luck, hope to see you on the moon",147

Not counting ""regular people"" buying it, like us, btw.

I always thought, and still do, that until utility and the usage itself is the main price-driving force, I shouldn't care as ""we're not there yet"".

We, the ""regular buyers"", should be the cherry on top, and I always felt that, at the end of the day, we will be a minuscule % of what affects the price.

But if this can affect the price with more impact than I thought, from utility itself...then I will just laugh cause that means, by ""my"" logic, that some of my ""impossible targets"" seem much easier to hit, lol.

This illustrates how xrp and the various RL stable coins with interact.  There will eventually be stable coins for most currencies.  The xrp acts as a bridge for exchanging. Quick and cheap.  the price of xrp may have to go up.  So a fraction of a coin will be needed to transact rather than a whole xrp.  I am a bit hazier on that detail but the diagram is correct.",2

XRP,2024-12-19,comment,Ripple,Comment on: How will RLUSD affect the price of XRP?...,"RLUSD is, in fact, a way for anyone but was designed for institutions to move their RWA (real world assets) into the digital world without risk of loss in a very general sense. Hince the name stable coin. 

With any market investment, including stable coins pegged to a certain value, like the federal reserve note. There is always the chance the RWA used to buy it could falter. Ie.. market crash, and so forth. 

Non the less, while the market holds  strength, it helps those with deep pockets off load thier reserve notes for something a bit more revolutionary. XRP is a deflationary asset, which means, over time.. at the rate at which xrp burns per transaction, it will take decades for it to show significant impact to the price. Rest assured though, 40, 50 years from now XRP will be #1 and nothing will topple it's riegn for a century i would wager. 

With lots a speculation of course. No one knows the future. I can tell you though it seems to me Ripple has thier act together. They continue to bring value and utility to the table. 

When, let's say half the world, move money for their purchases via the XRPL transactions, they will be in the millions a day. Hell, they might be that many already. RLUSD is meant to reduce the risk at entry and cover the value of the RWA. 

Not an advisor, and non of this is sourced information. Just my opinion on how this will work. If I had millions of dollars, I would certainly buy RLUSD for one simple fact. The US dollar $ since it was removed from the gold standard has steadily declined in value. I've been told the dollar only holds 3% value. That's right, 3%. 

Now imagine this scenario, I take my $5,000,000.00 and buy RLUSD with it. Then, sell the RLUSD to a different RWA. Let's say the Kuwaiti Dinar. Which has been notably the best performing RWA in recent history. $5 million @ 3% makes its true value 150,000. That's just stupid, but what happens when I switch RLUSD to the best value RWA, oil? Then, you've more than likely increased your value to face value or better.

With a set of eyes from an institution point of view, with some trials on beta severs or having AI run models on how to do this very thing. It could take a company on the brink of foreclosure to top 100, overnight? No?

Thanks, everyone, for reading. If you made it this far, I appreciate your time. I hope I've helped others understand how the new stable coin will work and bring value to the ledger, ultimately raising value on XRP itself.",2
XRP,2024-12-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: How will RLUSD affect the price of XRP?...,"OP this doesn’t answer your question, but adding it to the discussion so others can learn more about RLUSD and XRP’s relationship, and how David intends the system to work.

Transcript of David Schwartz's recent video explaining RLUSD.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9m--90PSg4

>Hi, this is David Schwartz, also known as JoelKatz, CTO at Ripple. I recently released a list of suggestions for XRP Ledger development, and I got a lot of questions about the stablecoin proposal. So I thought it might be helpful for me to walk through what I have in the design to give people a better idea of how I intended the system to work.

>Um, so first of all, it’s a collateralized stablecoin. That means tokenized assets whose value is are expected to remain constant in some unit. So if it’s a dollar stablecoin and you have 10 of it, you’re expecting its value to remain stable at $10. These assets have a backing asset, in this case, XRP. That means that there is something that is supposed to guarantee its value. Now, in some of those systems, you can actually redeem the stablecoin for the backing asset. In some, you can’t.

>What’s interesting about this proposal is that the stablecoins are perfectly liquid to XRP at face value on the ledger. So in other words, if you have a dollar and a dollar stablecoin designed on the system, what you have is a $1 claim on XRP, enforceable by The Ledger payment mechanics. And the reason that that’s important is with some other stablecoin designs, if the stablecoin isn’t popular, it won’t necessarily be liquid. If it’s not listed on an exchange, if it can’t easily be deposited and withdrawn, it won’t be that useful. By the design of this system, the stablecoins can be offered through the on-Ledger decentralized exchange, and they spend like XRP. So you don’t need to find some way to make them liquid. You can just spend them right on The Ledger. And of course, they can be pegged to anything that someone can provide a price feed on.

>Fiat currencies are probably what people typically think of, like dollars and Euros or whatever, but they can also be pegged to things like stocks or precious metals or any other value source as long as someone can provide a price feed for it. You can have a stablecoin pegged to that value.

>So there are five critical components to the system. There’s the operator, that’s the person or entity that provides the price feed and creates the system. There’s the price feed itself. There are the collateralized positions. These are the things that hold the collateral. Then there’s the Redemption process, which is the way that someone who holds the stablecoin converts it into XRP. And then there’s a series of incentives to ensure that the stablecoin remains convertible to sufficient XRP to back its value.",3

XRP,2024-12-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Ripple congrats on the new stable coin and what do...,"These are my 2 cents as someone that works in the area, the banking system runs on pretty legacy systems and through specific PSPs and SPIs, the idea is great and the technology is great but this legacy system exists for decades and is not easy to convince these central systems a better (outside) system exists for those in their ecosystem . There is some opening in EU and some Central Banks to decentralize transfer processing but if you investigate you will see they already are doing rnd into their own blockchains. My view is that XRP will provide the ecosystem’s for those that are not doing their rnd a outsourcing blockchain for IPS. XRP will be the white label of blockchain IPS. Based on this I predict if they get central players to adopt this a rise to 4-5$ in 2025 (mid) and 10$ in December 2025 if there is no adoption around 3$ and 6$ in December.

XRP,2024-12-07,post,Ripple,XRP price needs to be high instantly before regulations?,"So want to get thoughts from people, the price needs to shoot up high, thinking that $1000-$10,000 range before regulations come in. A high price to allow to cover all the money that will flow in from banks nostro/vostro accounts/any other assets that need to be covered. And slowly the value of XRP will be backed by assets to ensure it doesn’t crash. If it’s done after regulations, it will run into the risk of everyone pulling their money out from other markets to put into XRP knowing it will rise as the regulations state that it will be used by banks etc. 

TLDR; price needs to instantly be high to avoid crashing every other markets while implementing new system",18

Brad just met with Trump. He didn’t share details but they definitely talked about the lawsuit. The Trump team also knows about the XRP documentary so know all the BS that Ripple went through and how corrupt the SEC is. Now the SEC is being sued by 18 states! 

Trump WILL have a crypto friendly SEC chair. He wants to have bitcoin as a reserve and holds a lot crypto himself.

As a result, pro crypto regulations will be passed. Elon is part of DOGE (department of government efficiency), and this lawsuit is costing Ripple over 200+ million and the SEC is spending millions of taxpayer money in legal fees . Elon AND Vivek are pro crypto. They’ll put pressure to drop it.

I just watched a video regarding a future euro digital currency and need to know more! ,9
XRP,2025-01-28,comment,Ripple,Comment on: ELI5 how does the ripple network facilitate a CBDC...,"The XRPL ledger is a way of making XRP transactions publicly, immutably and free of censorship (kind of), without trusting a central bank. This part is no different to BCH or LTC.

Anyone can set up a token on the XRPL and the tokens move around the network in the same way as XRP. If the ECB was to set up an EURC (like Circle's) backed with real Euros it would be as good as Euros and a little easier to transact than traditional banking. The ECB would have some censorship and clawback ability.

XRP would still be needed as a base reserve on wallets and miniscule transaction fees. It may also actually as the currency of liquidity, but not necessarily.",3
XRP,2025-01-28,comment,Ripple,Comment on: ELI5 how does the ripple network facilitate a CBDC...,"So ripple the company is main contributor of xrp ledger .  In short, not to be too technical The xrpl ledger is where all cbdc would be connected and convert from euro to US dollar or euro to yen etc.
Now the use of xrp is not necessary to do this conversion but the fastest way is to use XRP so it would convert from euro to xrp then xrp to dollar for example.
However, again xrp is not necessary required but if this happens then it will burn 0.00001 xrp per transaction if I am correct.
Also the higher value for xrp the better because imagine bank want to transfer 1 millions euro they will need 300k plus xrp today for this transaction. If all play well and all partner with ripple use xrp ledger it will be massive for xrp price because also tokenisation is possible and that use xrp as well. an example in Europe is to check LCX which is basically Lichtenstein they are tokenising lot of asset on xrpl that burn xrp every time they do it.
The big deal now is cbdc is forbidden in USA but banks can connect to xrpl directly as well like Bank of America did in the past.
Ripple partnered with hundreds of banks but what I think is all banks are awaiting for sec lawsuit to finish or settle for good in USA before to make any move, however somehow it seems in October this year swift and most of bank seems to have discussed to go live with cryptocurrency based ledger but everyone is speculating which crypto it is. Could be any of iso20022 token like xrp,xlm,hbar,algorand,xdc and few others. This are the utilities of cryptocurrency and banks has been testing it since 2013 and this year the entire banking system is going to use cryptocurrency for transferring money arround the world because it’s cheap and fast and combine this with AI agent you get best trade for the money at low cost for the bank but bank will still charge you the same price ;)",3

You're asking a crystal ball question.  I think the correct answer will be, yes, xrp will absolutely rise in price going forward, with hills and valleys as any other.  

I'm planning on holding for 10 years, give or take, until it reaches a target of about 100.  Whichever comes first.  That's the long term exit plan.

Since I'm averaged in at about 1.20, my short exit plan is if it retraced back through to 2.00, then for every 20 cents i will withdrawal 25 percent of my stake.

Then get back in when the dip goes north again...

So...  man, wish I knew what it's gonna be worth in a hard number, that'd be nice...  good luck man!",2

Then it hit me… XRP’s not a cryptocurrency—it’s a psychological experiment. A loyalty test. A rite of passage.

If you hold long enough, you don’t get rich—you transcend materialism. You stop checking prices. You stop feeling. You become one with the blockchain. Cold. Immutable. Emotionless.

XRP,2025-02-05,post,Ripple,What is the advantage that XRP has over other cryptos?,"I am trying to understand the utility that XRP has over other cryptos. I see a passionate community but I cannot wrap my head around it.

Bitcoin is a safe store of value due to its decentralisation, PoW, and 21 mil cap.

Ethereum already has a big defi ecosystem.

Solana is user friendly, great trx rate, low fees - this comes down to its single-state design and PoH.

What advantages does XRP have?",67
XRP,2025-02-05,comment,Ripple,Comment on: What is the advantage that XRP has over other cryp...,">What advantages does XRP have?

XRP is cheaper, faster and more decentralized then every chain you just listed.  XRP Invented DEFI, having the first DEX and stablecoin back in 2012, built into the layer 1 protocol itself. Back before DEX's or stablecoins were even terms in the space.  

Nothing moves value from A to B faster or at a better rate then XRP.  Now you might read that and go so what you can go wallet to wallet, but you misunderstand what im saying when I say Value.

XRP has ILP and multi bridge currency swaps built into the protocol.  You can setup your wallet so that all incoming payments get automatically converted into whatever you choose to hold.  Dont wanna use XRP? No problem have incoming payments get swaped into USD and BTC 50/50.  How about you want to hold some stock? no problem re-allocate 10% of all incoming payments get converted into the stock of your choice, or bond, or Oil, or Gold/silver. All of which are traded on the XRPL atm.  XRP allows you to Transfer, and convert Whatever you have that has Value, and pay someone who might not even accept that form of payment and they get whatever ""value"" they want to receive.  That is the power of moving Value from A to B.

It also has many other advantages/utility.

Firstly its Deflationary, so Unlike BTC (which is dis-inflationary) or ETH (which can be inflationary or deflationary depending on the time of day)  XRP is always getting destroyed.

XRP is immune to 51% attacks.  The system is designed to be very resilient and strong, so much so that the concept of a 51% attack, isnt possible on the XRPL.

Network validators arent directly incentivized.  Since Validators dont earn a fee for doing the work required to uphold the network (like in BTC for example where Miners earn a Fee and can censor users from their block if they so chose to)  the XRPL says the best incentive is no incentive, There is no dictator of the block like in BTC. Nobody wants to gain control of the network or even attack it because there is no reward for doing so.  The people who value having a strong decentralized network, pay to run the network and build their business/operations off of it.",64

XRP,2025-02-05,comment,Ripple,Comment on: What is the advantage that XRP has over other cryp...,"Bitcoin is often seen as “digital gold” because people use it to store value, but it has some big issues…it’s slow, expensive to use, outdated, and bad for the environment. A single Bitcoin transaction in 2025 uses as much electricity as a U.S. home does in 46 days because its system (called Proof of Work) requires a huge amount of power to run!

On top of that, Bitcoin can only handle a small number of transactions at a time, which makes it very slow. When too many people are using it, the network gets clogged, and transaction fees go up. That means you either have to wait a long time or pay extra to get your transaction processed quickly.

Meanwhile, utility tokens are changing the game. These tokens aren’t just used for buying and selling, they actually do things within their blockchain networks. They can be used for services, voting on decisions, or earning rewards.

Blockchain technology in 2025 is improving very fast. New methods like zero knowledge rollups and Proof of Stake (PoS) are making transactions cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-hungry system, PoS uses way less power, making it a better long-term option.

Another big trend is tokenizing real world assets (like real estate, stocks, and supply chains), which could grow into a $2–30 trillion industry. This means blockchain isn’t just about crypto anymore, it’s becoming a huge part of the global economy. Which BTC was never designed for, or capable of. 

In short, Bitcoin is outdated when it comes to speed, cost, and energy use. That’s why utility tokens and new blockchain technology are gaining momentum, they provide more VALUE and are being adopted across industries at a fast pace. 

But as always, do your own research before making any big decisions.",24

XRP,2025-06-04,post,Ripple,XRP vs. SEC: The Slowdown,"I've been involved with XRP for quite a while now, and I constantly find myself pondering why its price remains so low. It boasts incredible utility and numerous partnerships, yet it's only hovering around $2. When you introduce someone new to XRP and highlight its massive potential, the first thing they often say after looking it up is, ""Only $2?""
I've come to a conclusion that, to me, makes the most sense: XRP was on the verge of fundamentally disrupting the financial institutions' established money-making systems. To prevent this, they initiated a lawsuit, effectively slowing down its progress. This delay gives them time to figure out how they can still profit while eventually leveraging Ripple's underlying technology.
 Do you agree with this theory, or do you have a different perspective on XRP's current price action?",29

XRP,2024-12-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Scaring of investors before ISO20022?...,"Repasting from a ripple discussion but another one that is pumping or fud is iso2022.

Iso20022 is a message structure that many chains can structure data to handle like algorand and xrp, but dyor dd on iso20022 hype, most of the articles are fake/misleading that list iso200222 cryptos together with xrp/ada/hbar/algorand/iota etc for about 18 months .

https://www.iso20022.org/faq

Ripple is a contributor to iso20022 which is neat though so assumption is they would be able to support the messaging standard along with more advance smart contracts like algorand (which can by structuring the note/message to the iso20022 standard)

“Cryptocurrencies are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant. There is a lot of confusion and misleading information on the web referring to ISO 20022 compliant cryptocurrencies but those statements are not correct. The cryptocurrencies are not managed and not registered by ISO 20022. ISO 20022 is a global standard for financial messaging and provides a common language and structure for exchanging financial information. The ISO standard managing Digital Token Identifiers (DTI) is ISO 24165.

While the financial institutions and payment systems have adopted or are in the process of adopting ISO 20022 standards for their operations, cryptocurrencies generally operate outside the traditional financial system and do not adhere to the ISO 20022 standard by default. Cryptocurrencies have their own protocols and messaging formats that are specific to each cryptocurrency’s blockchain network.”

“Yes. Cryptocurrencies can be transported as data content in the ISO 20022 messages but are not validated. Today flat currencies (EUR, USD, etc...) are used in the messages and validated against ISO 4217; cryptocurrencies validation will be implemented in future version of the ISO 20022 messages.”

“Yes. It’s worth noting that some cryptocurrency exchanges and payment processors may implement ISO 20022 compliance for their internal processes or interactions with traditional financial systems, such as banks and payment networks, to facilitate interoperability and compatibility with existing financial infrastructure. But at the protocol level, blockchains themselves are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant.”",6

XRP,2024-11-28,post,Ripple,Potential Ripple IPO Valuation 2025,"Things are looking pretty rosy for Ripple at the moment. There's a reasonable chance the appeal is going to be dropped altogether and even if it isn't not only is it relatively toothless, the new more-pro crypto heads of the SEC and CTFC, I doubt will push it as far as the Supreme Court.

Garlinghouse has always said the two things stopping an IPO were a) the lawsuit and b) a hostile SEC, both appear to be coming to an end in 2025. With all their new projects like the RUSD and probably the most friendly administration towards crypto in history *and* the general upbeat-ness of crypto in general at the moment. It seems to me that in the near future will be the perfect time for the CEO to announce their IPO.

I have some shares through EquityZen and I can see no one is selling them for any less than mid-$40's or about an $8B valuation. Only a couple of months ago it was half that. Even more interesting there were several sellers, I checked today and there are just two. One selling for mid-40's for common shares and a guy selling preferreds for low-$60's ($12B valuation).

Now, officially Ripple has a valuation of $11B after the last share buyback in Jan, but with recent developments in the cryptosphere I think it's safe to say we're looking at a figure quite a bit north of that on the open market.

Questions is though - how much north?

The most brilliant scenario is that Ripple is valued much like Microsoft Solutions (MSTR). MSTR are a piece of shit company, but they own a shit-ton of Bitcoin as well. So, despite not being profitable they have a ridiculously high valuation of around $80B.

Coincidentally, Ripple holds about 80 billion XRP or a current value of approx. $120B. Naturally, with a more friendly crypto environment, no lawsuit etc this figure/price of XRP it's highly likely that this value would significantly increase.

Probably a more realistic view is that Ripple gets a boost from holding XRP, but it's valuation isn't fully impacted because they are quite a bit more limited than MSTR with distribution.

Thing is though this is a very roundabout way of saying I haven't a foggiest on fair value! And if you ignore all the scammers and shills finding any realistic targets from people more well-informed in surprisingly difficult.

What are people's thoughts? What do you think might be a fair valuation of ripple in 2025?",41
XRP,2024-12-01,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Potential Ripple IPO Valuation 2025...,"It's weird to me that on a forum for the actually company in question, which has been viewed 9,000 times, the only responses I've pretty much got about an IPO/valuation is two people wanting to defend MSTR over a throwaway remark. It's disheartening to think I could have posted 'Is it tooo late ti buay?' and probably gotten about 30 responses.",7
XRP,2024-12-21,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Potential Ripple IPO Valuation 2025...,"I feel like I researched this a couple years ago and found some decent arguments for valuing Ripple if it were to IPO. I pulled the trigger on some share back in April of this year for about $39/share from Linqto, but that was before the price explosion of XRP. Shares have been sold out on there for a while but now are back and they are going for $116/share giving it an implied market valuation of $20B. 

But I was under the impression that Ripple holds closer to 55 Billion XRP in escrow. 

Anyways, as someone alluded to below they couldn't ever just sell it all, so that makes you have to discount their holdings for their current valuation. However, I look at XRP's adoption, RLUSD's quick adoption and think XRP price could easily jump up quite a bit.

I think the main differences between Ripple and MSTR, is as you mentioned their underlying business. Ripple has a chance to be making an enormous profit if XRP is adopted throughout the world and is fully integrated into the financial system, not even considering their XRP holdings IMO. But like MSTR I think having substantial holdings would give them value beyond the token's worth, via different creative mechanism, such as loans.

IDK its obviously not an easy question to answer but I put it as a high risk high reward bet just like buying XRP, but I think the upside is easily over $100B valuation for the company if XRP is widely adopted, and that would be on the low side IMO. So then I ask myself if XRP continues to be adopted and XRP price continues to rise prior to an IPO, I rather continue scooping private shares now before the market is offered it and could shoot the price up even more. 

  
Here is the article I found last time I researched this btw, and the lady uses Coinbase's IPO as a gauge of how Ripple might do in an IPO

XRP,2025-03-07,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Potential Ripple IPO Valuation 2025...,"I think a lot of the valuation would have to come down to their AVAILABLE (i.e. liquid, un-escrowed, market-dilution weighted) holdings of XRP. 

If XRP stays at, say $3, and they have POTENTIAL access to (conservatively) $100m per escrow (per month, ish, I think?), and again we say (conservatively) they use up 10% of it i.e. $10m/month, without affecting the market negatively, then that's $120,000,000 in potential cash flow per year based ONLY on XRP sales (or lending, liquidity provision, market making, or whatever else they can do with it).

Now you have to assume they have at LEAST $1-2b in cash in a bank too, since they had $1b I believe before the court case (which cost $100-200m – ouch!). 

I believe they are also debt-free. 

And we haven't even started talking about non-XRP related business. E.g. transaction fees from ODL/RippleNet transfers or loans, and so on. 

Let alone they own an AI company, are now balls deep in custodial solutions, hold countless software and business IPs... I could go on. 

They are an absolute monster. I personally believe they could be a trillion dollar company one day.",3

XRP,2024-12-03,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Potential Ripple IPO Valuation 2025...,"I'm trying to find an evaluation myself. VISA IPO'd in 2008 with an evaluation of $17.9B. Perhaps that could be a conservative number for Ripple when they IPO.

I'm literally on the fence of purchasing some private shares now.

The positive outlook:

1. SEC case is over - imagine the growth once it's put to bed
2. XRP clarity
3. Continual growth/expansion/partnerships during SEC crackdown
4. No layoffs, continually hiring

So yeah, I think a 45%-60% increase in evaluation before IPO could occur if comparing to VISA back in 2008. But I literally know NOTHING about this. I've never invested in private shares before. I'm just researching as you are.

XRP,2025-06-03,post,Ripple,Chart Info & Trading Analysis,"I’m a long term trader and investor. I’ve been around since the start of crypto, called DOGE many of times and other currencies with 80% or more accuracy.

Here is the chart information for XRP.
1 Week graphs show a strong bull flag.
5m graphs show another increase.

Within 2 months max we should be around $3.50 again and with upcoming ETF launches and more coming in July we could see $10 with FOMO investors.

Remove XRP from exchanges and store in a cold wallet.

The reason XRP price is not rising is because of Ripple holding 43% of total supply while the rest remain on exchanges. The $10mil or more investments from institutional companies are made on the private ledger priced at $375,000 per XRP while the global public ledger on exchanges are at the rates shown in the images.

Ripple will merge the two wallet after 2028-2030 when full integration of ISO 20022 is implemented. Either way, the 1 week candles show a strong buy signal coming up very soon.

At that time, I didn't know jack about how different crypto was to traditional investments like shares etc.

After the market crapped itself, between Harmony ($ONE), Terra Luna ($LUNC), and Solana ($SOL), I was down by 92%.

Not a pleasant feeling, I must admit - let's call it COVID-madness.

NOW, with all the hoo-ha about XRP, I've done a bit of reading to find out what is the big deal, and why all you guys are so excited. 

At first, I was dumbfounded as to how it was any different to any other coin. Then I came across [this](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/16767579477001).

I noticed, all the major Australian banks were listed here. Sceptical as I was, I did more digging until I found [this](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-12/c2023-403207-ripple.pdf) from the Australian Department of Treasury & Finance.

I'm now thinking, maybe it's time to get rid of the ETH/BTC and add more XRP and/or SOL. Now I can't decide which one (or both), I like them both.

XRP,2025-01-25,comment,Ripple,Comment on: I had a golden goose and didn't know it...,"DYOR. XRP is owned by Ripple Labs. Investigate thoroughly, and you will discover- for yourself and by yourself- that there is no other token/coin that has its tentacles in as many companies as Ripple Labs does. Google ‘Brad Garlinghouse meets with’ and see how many companies around the world he has been making deals with. Read the XRP Whitepaper. Read it again. There is no better long-term play than XRP. It is THE bridge currency that works with ALL other currencies, fiat and crypto, moves money in any amount, anywhere in the world, in 5 seconds or less, and does it for $0.0002 percent per transaction. Do the math: when every single transaction in the U.S. alone could total around $846 billion, calculate how much 1 XRP token must be worth to support that number. Your result will be somewhere between $10,000.00 and $35,000.00 per XRP token. Now, sit back and ponder that- then make a wise decision. Again, Do Your Own Research. Find. YORX Superior Trading on YouTube: he is an analyst, does his own research, and, after watching his videos for two whole years, I have seen his predictions on many, many crypto-related actions actually become reality. In other words, he can be trusted to give you the straight story. He provides proof of what he is saying. Also, when the BIS- Bank of International Settlements- the Central Bank of the rest of the world (other than the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank), mentions XRP and  XLM in their own documents- what more evidence does one need to realize the right choice? I recommend you invest in XLM & XRP, sit down, strap in, and hold on. By 2030, you will be so very glad you did this. Also, HBAR, XDC, QUANT, LINK, are all very good bets.

The new digital reserve really is just about BTC and XRP. And they'll find out soon enough that BTC. Even with lightning network, is still too slow against XRP. 

I still stand by what I said before that XRP won't have parabolic changes until 2027. But I've been wrong before when I thought BTC will only go to $400 (back in 2010 when it was $0.40).",7

So, I'm guessing a lot will be known in the next year or two, regardless of the result and whether Ripple succeeds with all the plans they have or not.

XRP,2024-12-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: How fast?...,"2025 will be the start of real world utility and when we see a corresponding price increase in XRP.

Japan will be the catalyst, once other world governments witness Japan going from a slow, outdated, technologically inferior state (with respect to finance), to a global world leader (at the flick of a switch), many many more will follow suit. They literally can't afford not to. 

From 2025 to 2030 we will start to see progressive adoption further increasing XRP demand and therefore price increases.

From there on the price will be dictated by Ripples success in establishing XRP as the status quo for international financial movement. When I look at the Ripple team, I personally see a team of people who can make this happen. 

If achieved XRP may well be looked at as the investment of a lifetime, if not lifetimes - think Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Amazon in the early days type of investment.

Just my humble opinion. DYOR. NFA.",22

XRP,2024-12-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: How fast?...,"Iso20022 is a message structure that many chains can structure data to handle like algorand and xrp, but dyor dd on iso20022 hype, most of the articles are fake/misleading that list iso200222 cryptos together with xrp/ada/hbar/algorand/iota etc for about 18 months .

 https://www.iso20022.org/faq

Ripple is a contributor to iso20022 which is neat though so assumption is they would be able to support the messaging standard along with more advance smart contracts like algorand (which can by structuring the note/message to the iso20022 standard)



“Cryptocurrencies are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant. There is a lot of confusion and misleading information on the web referring to ISO 20022 compliant cryptocurrencies but those statements are not correct. The cryptocurrencies are not managed and not registered by ISO 20022. ISO 20022 is a global standard for financial messaging and provides a common language and structure for exchanging financial information. The ISO standard managing Digital Token Identifiers (DTI) is ISO 24165.

While the financial institutions and payment systems have adopted or are in the process of adopting ISO 20022 standards for their operations, cryptocurrencies generally operate outside the traditional financial system and do not adhere to the ISO 20022 standard by default. Cryptocurrencies have their own protocols and messaging formats that are specific to each cryptocurrency’s blockchain network.”

“Yes. Cryptocurrencies can be transported as data content in the ISO 20022 messages but are not validated. Today flat currencies (EUR, USD, etc...) are used in the messages and validated against ISO 4217; cryptocurrencies validation will be implemented in future version of the ISO 20022 messages.”

“Yes. It’s worth noting that some cryptocurrency exchanges and payment processors may implement ISO 20022 compliance for their internal processes or interactions with traditional financial systems, such as banks and payment networks, to facilitate interoperability and compatibility with existing financial infrastructure. But at the protocol level, blockchains themselves are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant.”",7

XRP,2025-06-18,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Trident $500M XRP Treasury Plan...,In my opinion there are many reasons. Amongst the vast majority of “moonbois” there’s a few who actually want to learn about XRP and what’s going on with it. People only hear other people say that there is mass adoption but never really find any news about it and people who ignore news like this only focus solely on the price. Then you’ll see post thats like “$5” or “$10” is their exit. In my opinion that’s just a few checkpoints for people to get off before the price goes up more.

XRP,2024-11-25,post,Ripple,Ripple Announces First Tokenized Money Market Fund on the XRPL,"Ripple has announced its partnership with Archax and abrdn to launch a tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

\- Archax will provide access to a money market fund from the UK asset manager, abrdn, in a tokenized form on the decentralized blockchain.

**Key Details:**

\- The fund comprises part of abrdn's £3.8B US dollar liquidity Fund (Lux) fund and represents the first tokenized money market fund on the XRPL.

\- The move places the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

\- *""The arrival of abrdn’s money market fund on XRPL demonstrates how real-world assets are being tokenized to enhance operational efficiencies, while further reinforcing the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for real-world asset tokenization,""* said Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President, RippleX.

\- According to a report by McKinsey, the tokenized money market funds market has reached an impressive milestone, with assets under management now exceeding $1B.

\- Moreover, looking ahead, some forecasts suggest that the total value of tokenized assets could skyrocket to an astonishing $16 trillion by the year 2030. This remarkable growth underscores a burgeoning demand for innovative financial solutions in the evolving digital finance landscape.

\- Ripple will invest $5M in tokens associated with abrdn’s Lux fund. This investment marks a significant milestone as part of a broader initiative by Ripple to channel funds into Real-World Assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

\- This larger fund will be managed by a diverse group of experienced asset managers, reflecting Ripple's commitment to enhancing the utility and integration of blockchain technology in traditional financial markets.",126

1. CBDCs: Could offer seamless funds-transmission between different currencies, but requires (1) the development of currency-specific CBDCs, which only a handful of countries have done, (2) a major reconfiguration of the banking system within said country, and (3) interoperability between CBDCs.

2. SWIFT’s GPI: Though it takes a lot less time than traditional cross-border settlements, it can still take a few hours up to a day and is thus incomparable to XRP’s speed.

3. Stablecoins: Require pre-funded liquidity pools, have higher fees than XRP, and face regulatory hurdles.

XRP seems to be vastly ahead with its instant ODL, unmatched speed, negligible fees, regulatory compliance, ISO 20022 integration, tokenomics, and ease of practical application.

Fees on altcoins vary depending on liquidity. Newly-supported or small cap tokens are typically less liquid and incur higher fees.

During periods of increased volatility, our fees will increase. We hold each price open for 18 seconds. 

Our pricing also factors in the risk we are taking by holding inventory.

When market spreads are unusually wide (over 4%), we display an in-app notification so you can choose whether to go ahead or not.

Spreads on EUROC are wider than other Stablecoins due to higher volatility and limited liquidity.

The trade volume is not yet very active, that is likely the most interesting metric to monitor. The higher activity you see shown in late Feb thru early March was possibly more stress testing ?

Knowing all that, you can win slightly more over time. But no one, absolutely no one is right all the time. So risk management is key.

XRP,2024-12-02,comment,Ripple,Comment on: RLUSD and XRP...,"So normally when people want to pull out of crypto to either hold their funds or avoid a drop in prices, they sell for a stable coin. Usually that’s when usdt is bought, and their market cap can get really high during a bear market. Because people don’t want to leave crypto completely and have fiat.

Usdt is a stable coin on the ether block chain, it kind of props up ether a bit. But I think Brad garlinghouse mentioned in an interview that the sec is now going after usdt and ether, it would make sense for ripple to have a stable coin for people to use. 

I think this interview was before Mr trump won the election. No one really knows what the sec will do in the future right now.",7

XRP,2025-02-27,post,Ripple,How would a higher market cap be supported?,"I'm still learning here and this is an honest question. 

If I'm understanding correctly; the Ripple network and XRP are meant to facilitate payments, largely bypassing the expensive and cumbersome SWIFT network.  That sounds great.

But if XRP is meant to facilitate and process payments among peers and financial institutions, and not as a store of value, won't most users only hold XRP for a few seconds, just enough to facilitate their transaction?  It means most of the time, the value of XRP should remain stable and there should be no point when the price skyrockets. 

I know a lot of people are hodling XRP and hoping it'll hit the moon.  My question is why would it shoot up in price if its use case calls for quick in-and-out transactions most of the time?  It seems that for transacting, a stable value would be preferable.

What am I missing?  Those of you who know Ripple better, please enlighten me. ✌️

XRP,2025-03-01,comment,Ripple,Comment on: How would a higher market cap be supported?...,"Because according to Goog the daily value of global SWIFT transactions is around $22T. So the amount of XRP available to the system would have to be substantially higher than it is today. A mere 8x increase over its current value ($2.18 per token = $127B market cap) would only give it a $1T market cap. You have to also remember that a lot of the XRP will be held offline or in personal wallets and not even available to the system to use.

So what im expecting is a face melting rise in value to whatever predetermined value our dear leaders have already determined will be required for the system to operate as desired, and then it would remain relatively static +/- a few %.

And considering that it might possibly become the new major global payment system, I don't think a $10T market cap (80x its current value or about $100 per token) would be out of the question.",1

XRP,2025-05-09,post,Ripple,Trade like a casino. Not like a gambler.,"Casinos don't win every hand.

They win over time - because they have rules, odds, and discipline.

Let's take an example:

American roulette has 38 numbers: 1–36, 0, and 00.

If you bet $1 on a single number, you win $35 if it hits.

Your chance of winning = 1/38  
Your chance of losing = 37/38

The Expected Value (EV) per $1 bet:  
= (Win probability × Win payout)  
\+ (Lose probability × Loss)  
That's −0.0526.

So on average, you lose 5.26 cents for every $1 bet.  
That’s a 5.26% loss per spin.

The house edge = the expected loss per $1 bet.

So, 5.26% is the casino’s built-in profit margin on that game.

It’s not luck. It’s mathematical advantage over time.

Here's what you should do:

🎯	Know your edge  
Every strategy must have a positive expectancy. If it doesn't — stop trading.

📊	Play the long game	  
Single trades are noise. Your edge shows up over 100+ trades.

💰	Risk small per trade  
Casinos don’t go all-in on one spin. Neither should you.

📏	Stick to the system	No emotions. No chasing. Just execution.

💼	Log and review everything	  
Casinos track every stat. You should too.",5

XRP,2025-02-14,post,Ripple,XRP and Stable Coins,"I just posted this on my other account but here goes nothing haha. 

Xrp (I can’t post on there not enough Karma) please read.

Q:So why XRP will do well? 

A (My theory): USA is moving towards stable coins. We have printed to much cash and don’t have anything to back it up. We want to move back to gold, assets, and essentially bitcoin. The way we do that is make stable coins. These stablecoins can be backed by real-world assets (such as USD, EUR, or commodities) and traded on the decentralized exchange (DEX) within the XRPL. Also they are backed by USA treasury bonds. XRP is the bridge. XRPL supports the issuance of stablecoins and other digital assets through its built-in Issued Currencies (previously known as lOUs). This allows financial institutions, businesses, or even individuals to issue stablecoins on the XRP Ledger. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution uses XRP to facilitate instant cross-border payments. In cases where stablecoins are used for settlements, XRP can still serve as a bridge asset to enhance liquidity and enable efficient transfers between different fiat and stablecoin corridors. The XRP Ledger has a built-in DEX, where users can trade stablecoins against XRP and other assets. This allows for fast and low-cost conversion between stablecoins and XRP. 

EX: Imagine a financial institution issues a USD-backed stablecoin on the XRPL. A user in Europe wants to convert that USD stablecoin into a Euro-backed stablecoin.
Instead of finding direct liquidity between USD-stablecoin and EUR-stablecoin, XRP can act as an intermediary, making the transaction faster and cheaper.",23
XRP,2025-02-14,comment,Ripple,Comment on: XRP and Stable Coins...,"Remember, there was a time when gold and silver certificates were backed up by something other than faith. I have absolutely no faith in the government whether it be left right or center. As soon as this president is out the next one will retract everything and when this one is done vice versa. So, I think your prediction, assumption is a good one. Bitcoin is too slow. It’s only purpose is to save assets. Whereas XRP, as you stated serves purpose. All of this is going to come to surface within the next few years. Those who do not see the value in XRP are going to wish they did once it hits record highs. However, I think it will always be a utility coin and never a stablecoin, so its price will be volatile. Still, I plan on putting everything I have in a cold wallet and not touching it. I’ll hand the keys over to my safe on my deathbed with my seed phrase to my daughter. Trying to accumulate whatever I can. But until then, I’m going to enjoy the next 30 or so years.

If Ripple achieves its utility goals for cross border payments using XRP, then I think it would be likely for XRP to break its XRP/BTC high, and quite possibly one day even flip BTC for market cap. My feeling is that we are quite a long way from that ever happening but damn would I love to be proven wrong!",19
XRP,2025-01-26,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Would XRP/BTC All time high be broken ever?...,"XRP's price is currently driven mostly by speculators. To see it gain significant market cap, it needs to gain significant adoption and usage in it's designed, intended role: the business of transferring large sums between different countries/currencies.

What are the obstacles in the way of XRP being adopted and used as designed and intended? There are probably more issues than I am aware of, but what I see as some of the bigger issues are:  

* The SEC aggravation needs to be put to bed once and for all. Everyone is hopeful that this is imminent.  
* Then across multiple jurisdictions, there will likely still be further bureaucratic red-tape to navigate (laws, rules, regulations, policies, etc). If it involves a legislature or regulatory agency, that can be a very slow process. Some locales may be easy in this regard. I rather suspect most will be a slog because of the way that governments typically are. This step holds risk of monkey-wrenching (ala the SEC's maliciousness, the potential for SWIFT leveraging global political connections that it's spent decades developing and grooming, all that sort of bureaucratic tyranny and oligarchy-esque bull-butter).
* Then the banks themselves have an I.T. effort to implement the option for XRP within their bank systems. Even though Ripple has a published API to assist implementers, there still needs to be design, development, testing, training, documentation, etc and every step along the way likely requires meetings, consensus, decisions, approvals, QA checks, and on and on. 

I don't see it like flipping a light switch everywhere, all at once. I tend to think adoption & usage will come on gradually/regionally. Even if the biggest institutions were to have everything in place and ready to go, they may still hold off until smaller institutions have a quarter or two of actual usage to report -- sort of a , ""This looks great!! But you go first!"" attitude. 

Even faced with all that, Ripple/XRP is staying the course and doing what they can to keep it moving forward. Hence, I hold firm.",16

XRP,2025-02-10,post,Ripple,"As the Cheetah commences to chase after the Gazelle, does it think, ""I hope I'll catch it, otherwise I'll be hungry for 3 days""!?","The quickest mammal on Earth, the Cheetah,  can reach a speed of 100km/h in under 3 seconds. A McLaren 765LT with a price tag of over a half a million USD, does it in 2.8 seconds.

When the Cheetah reaches its peak acceleration, it can only run for a few seconds more by which time, it will have expended so much energy, that it takes the poor cat over 3-days of total rest to recover from the dash. 

If it doesn't catch the Gazelle it set about to hunt, the torment of those three, or more, days will be coupled with the excruciating pain of hunger.

Yet, the Cheetah will keep going at it until a Gazelle falls victim to its speed and agility. Therefore, I don't think the thought ever occurs to the Cheetah if it will, or will not feast on the Gazelle - it simply hunts without regard for hunger, failure, or success.

I see hundreds of posters on various crypto communities commenting, and seeking advice, in a mad panic, about whether to sell their coin(s) or not because they're anxious about the ""crash"" of one coin or another, or the whole crypto market, and whatever else that bugs them. 

Maybe, said good folks, should consider if they're suited for the ""hunt"" or not!?

In other words, if you're not prepared to ache in every part of your exhausted body, and potentially go hungry for 3 or more days, maybe you should consider not hunting Gazelles!!

Why get into a boxing match with Mike Tyson if you're not prepared for the pain?

And if you decided to get in the ring for a round with Mike, why ask the crowd how or when to get out? 

Moral of the stories, why gamble in the crypto market which is known for frequent tidal waves of volatility, when you don't have the stomach for it!?

What are your thoughts on this please!?",0

XRP,2025-01-29,post,Ripple,HODL XRP on Ledger / Bep20 / ERC20,"Guys I am really feeling lost to which way XRP should be in my custody. While some exchanges provide withdrawal only on ripple ledger while others Only to Bep20 and ERC20 adresses. As we all are here to HODL what should i do as i hold 80% major in Bep20/erc20 supporting exchange while 20% in only ripple ledger supporting exchange.

1. If i move my assets to hardware wallet which can be considered future proof or is this my just assumption as all format is legit ?
2. How easy is this to swap or does it even need to swap in between them?
3. As most if hardware wallets support both formats should i keep it as it is or its mandatory to swap before keeping it as store of value. Please guide me as even after holding xrp in both formats i am still worried if it may loose any value.",2

XRP,2024-11-25,post,Ripple,Case report day 2285 ,"Well, at this point, there aren’t any daily discussion threads to comment on.

Six years ago, a 20 year old me stumbled upon XRP through trying to buy something on a part of the internet where only cryptocurrency could be used. It was only when I was forced to pay with bitcoin that I realized cryptocurrency was…money. 

Since that point, and since I learned what XRP was, and what Ripple was doing with it, I made a decision to center everything in my life around getting every XRP I could at such low prices. I knew that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I knew that putting everything else to the side in my life would pay off exponentially down the road. I knew cryptocurrency as a whole would become more mainstream, but I knew more specifically that XRP was fundamentally rock solid, and grossly undervalued. 

Every single day, for years, it’s all that mattered. I didn’t care about my social life, I didn’t care about a relationship, I didn’t care about my own mental health even, I needed to get every single dollar I possibly could and put it into XRP. Some would’ve equated it to going to a casino and putting it all on red, but i knew this was a risk to reward unlike any other in human history. 

Most would’ve thought I was crazy. I knew I had a better path than going into college and debt, making decent to good money and putting it all on the line. I knew I was prepared to execute a 5+ year strategy to see this through. 

2021 was an amazing year for me, I saw my dreams come true. I also invested in Vechain on a fundamental basis and watched it go from half a cent to 27 cents. I was in awe, but I held through the bear market cashing out essentially what I had invested before the downtrend. After watching XRP and Vechain do literally nothing for years, it was a hell of a ride. I knew it was only a matter of time before it recovered, and it was back into accumulation mode. 

Ripple won the lawsuit, Gary Gensler is on the way out, every single piece that has needed to fall into place, is happening. I never fully knew how my life would transform, but all I know is I’m happy that I did everything i did now. All I have to do is…nothing. This is all just getting started, and it’s all just speculation. We don’t even have utility on a real level creating a price floor. We just have everyone starting to realize this is the future. That the way everything else has advanced in every facet of life technologically, the entire money settlement system of the world will also advance and change, it is only a matter of time. 

I still could be wrong I guess, but I really don’t think so ;) ",39

When I look at projects like helium and how they are trying to monetize IOT data and makes me rather curious.

Question 1: do we really believe that the institutional money/Wales is getting into this space?
Question 2: has the token price gone parabolic recently?
Question 3: is it true that whales and institutional traders are able to manipulate prices in the short run by placing huge trades one way or the other?
Question 4: are those same whales and institutional traders likely shaking out the weak hands vis-à-vis this recent selling?
Question 5: do we still believe in the long-term bull case for XRP?

XRP,2024-08-02,post,Ripple,"shit price action, lets give each other smth to be bullish","BRICS countries are teaming up to create a new cross-border payments system, breaking away from SWIFT. Ripple is partnering with companies in at least 2 of the member countries (Brazil and India).

SWIFT takes a couple of days to settle transactions and does not work on weekends and bank holidays. Ripple is 24/7, with near-instant settlement.

**TO USE SWIFT, BANKS HAVE TO PREFUND OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES AND KEEP BALANCES ON THESE NOSTROS ACCOUNTS.**

ChatGPT estimates there are roughly $15 trillion locked in these accounts. **RIPPLE UNLOCKS THESE $15 TRILLION WITH ODL. AND WE KNOW RIPPLE IS PARTNER WITH 80+ PAYOUTS MARKET.**

The reality is that where there are market opportunities, others will want their share. 

That isn't to say that Ripple doesn't, or won't, have significant control of certain remittance corridors, and they will likely have significant control of these globally.

I often see XRP holders refer to it as 'the one', perhaps jt was at one tjme, but Ripple has a direct remittance competitor who have made it their core mission to become the Ripple of Asia. 

Many may read this and think the competitor that I refer to is some new start up trying to copy Ripple, but having done countless hours of research into the matter, said competitor is backed by major institutions, including the largest conglomerate in Thailand and they also own the majority share of the 6th largest company in China... and they're partnered with Visa.

Factually speaking, Ripple doesn't have exclusivity in the blockchain cross-border remittance space, even with banks it has partnered with (eg Siam Commercial Bank) where Ripple has agreements for certain Asian corridors and said competitor has agreements in place for others

You can look this up yourself, and the above doesn't detract from my personal view that I think Ripple has a very bright future, but my point is that it isn't alone anymore and competitors exist, including ones with deep pockets, established partners and significant influence via their backers.",3

XRP,2024-08-13,post,Ripple,Ripple's Strategic Partnership with DIFC Innovation Hub to Drive Blockchain Adoption in the Middle East,"In case you missed it, has recently announced a significant strategic partnership with the DIFC Innovation Hub, a leading technology hub in the Middle East, aimed at accelerating blockchain adoption across the region, particularly within the UAE’s financial landscape. This partnership, with the largest innovation hub in the region that houses over 1,000 growth-stage tech firms and venture capitalists, is set to connect developers and tech innovators with the financial infrastructure necessary to drive their success.

This collaboration has the potential to revolutionize early-stage companies and scale-ups by providing them with access to Ripple’s resources, facilitating the integration of blockchain technology into established institutions. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has highlighted the UAE’s advanced regulatory environment as a crucial factor in fostering financial innovation, stating that this partnership will further accelerate blockchain adoption, with the XRP Ledger continuing to play a leading role in the region.

Ripple has committed one billion XRP to accelerate global use cases on the XRP Ledger, a commitment that now extends to the Middle East. This initiative will provide financial, technical, and business support to developers in the region, reinforcing Ripple’s global strategy. Arif Amiri, CEO of DIFC, described the partnership as a milestone in equipping the next generation of leaders with the tools for success, solidifying DIFC’s position as a global hub for innovation.

Ripple’s Middle East and Africa (MEA) office, located within the DIFC, has already seen XRP approved for use within the Centre, allowing licensed firms to incorporate XRP into their services. This move is expected to further drive blockchain innovation in Dubai. Mohammad Alblooshi, CEO of the DIFC Innovation Hub, expressed his excitement about the tangible impact this collaboration will have on the Hub’s growing community of fintech and innovation firms.

Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the UAE’s progressive fintech environment and noted that this partnership would empower regional talent to build the next generation of financial solutions on the XRP Ledger. As Ripple continues its global expansion with this partnership, it reaffirms its position as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation. This collaboration marks a significant step forward in Ripple’s mission to drive blockchain adoption and innovation in the Middle East, positioning the company to make a lasting impact on the region's financial landscape.  
  
I'd love to hear your input about the UAE's regulatory environment and its role in fostering blockchain innovation. Could this be a model for other regions looking to integrate blockchain into their financial systems?",43

“The tender offer was oversubscribed and a little more than 3% of the Fund’s holdings were sold in the offering.”

Ripple was budgeted for and bought a total of 12%. It was an open tender. And just as with an IPO anyone could pay for equity and only a few get it, or usually only get a partial allotment, the *funds* were only able to sell 3%.

Hypothetical scenario. Say there were 100 entities. Ripple had put up an open tender but they didn’t know how many would be interested in selling. They expect 50% would be interested. But 100% did. They give everyone a chance to sell, to be fair. So everyone gets to sell 3% instead. But Ripple buys 6%. Both times. Total 12%",2

To clarify they set a aside a fixed amount of money for the buyback they don't double what they planned to purchase if the demand is higher. In the first buyback they set aside $285 million to buyback up to 6%. They don't then spend $570 million if demand is really high the just buy back fewer shares per participant.",2
XRP,2024-12-03,post,Ripple,Rippex - cold storage,"Hi all!
7-8 years ago I printed out a list of the top 25 cryptocurrencies at the time and threw a dart arrow. The arrow landed on Ripple / xrp and I ended up buying what today would be considered a sufficient amount. 

At the time of buying I used a program called Rippex as interface to the blockchain, which is no longer existing. All passwords / keys / seeds whatever were written down by hand on a piece of paper, which further was put in an envelope before being locked up inside my safe. I remember doing a check some years back (after rippex ended), that the coins were still registered at the same address in the chain, which they were. I guess that should be comforting? 

What software can be used if I would like to access my coins for further transferring them to Coinbase / Binance or similar?

Any guidance would be much appreciated. I am at a point in my life when it would make sense to sell some of it, given the recent price development.

XRP,2024-11-13,post,Ripple,Exciting time ahead of us but don’t forget your goals,"I’ve been into crypto since 2018, every new cycle is quite exciting and impressive but keep in mind your goals. For new investors and not so old one like I am remember your goals, remember to take profits if you agree to that particular investment technique. In the upcoming weeks people are gonna call for some ridiculous price points, people are gonna push super bullish narrative and setting some of your bags is gonna feel like making the biggest mistake of your life but it isn’t. 

Keep your minds focused on your personal targets, try not getting influenced by others. Believe in your own plan to become financially free no matter what it is and stick to it. 

If you achieve 80% gains, 200% or even 1000% you are still a winner and succeeded in the investing world. It’s not about what you could’ve made but what you actually made. 

These runs don’t last a very long time and always feel like they’ll never end but they do. Tokens do end up correcting 70-90%. Even if people push some ridiculous narratives the market still comes to exhaustion at one point. 

With this in mind, I wish you all the greatest gains of your life and hope that each and every one of you comes out of this next bullrun richer than ever.

Cheers boys",22
XRP,2024-11-13,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Exciting time ahead of us but don’t forget your go...,"""The true run"", **IF** it happens, will (**most likely**) not be one of these ""cycle runs"" where it's based on...whatever + FOMO.

It will be based on usage by companies, banks, and so on, and we, mere mortals and private investors will just be the creme on the top, when it comes to price increase.

In short, I'm not reacting to this in any way, and if I set my targets 7 years ago, which are ""impossible"" for most people here, there's no point in ruining that plan.  
Either I'm set for life (which is much easier where I live), or I get nothing. I'm fine with that.

Yes, we could have a situation where the price never reaches my targets, or even just a couple of dollars, and that's fine. If I don't get anything out of it, who cares. The money was spent a long time ago, so it's the same as if I went out and spent money to party and now it's lost.",8

XRP,2024-11-13,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Exciting time ahead of us but don’t forget your go...,"Very true, made that mistake before on the last run!

Set a “realistic” target that you would be happy to sell at and execute. Better to get a good profit than risk loosing it, in hopes of better profit (that might never come).

Don’t be swayed by the crazy targets some people call out, from my experience — this has never happened. Even when people were calling BTC to top out last cycle at 100k — realty was it topped at 60’ishk — so set that difference of percentage as a rough guide.

You can always buy more during the next bear market but, in the mean while at least you have more money now to do so or spend it on something else.",3
XRP,2024-11-15,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Exciting time ahead of us but don’t forget your go...,I am more happy to lose everything I've invested than to take a 100 to 500% profit now only to see it moon soon after.

XRP,2024-09-12,post,Ripple,Grayscale Investments Launches Grayscale XRP Trust,,78
XRP,2024-09-12,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Grayscale Investments Launches Grayscale XRP Trust...,that's the bump,13
XRP,2024-09-13,comment,Ripple,Comment on: Grayscale Investments Launches Grayscale XRP Trust...,"The launch of the Grayscale XRP Trust could potentially have a positive impact on the price of XRP, though the extent of the effect depends on several factors. Here’s a speculative breakdown of what might happen:

1. **Increased Demand**: The trust makes it easier for institutional investors, and even some retail investors, to gain exposure to XRP. As more people buy shares of the trust, Grayscale will need to purchase more XRP to hold within the trust. This increase in demand for XRP could drive up its price.

2. **Institutional Confidence**: Grayscale is a well-known player in the cryptocurrency investment world, and the launch of an XRP trust could signal to the broader financial community that XRP is a more legitimate or stable investment. This could attract new institutional investors who were previously hesitant, further increasing demand.

3. **Reduced Supply on the Open Market**: Since Grayscale will likely hold significant amounts of XRP in its trust, the available supply of XRP on the open market may decrease. When demand remains constant or increases while supply decreases, prices tend to rise.

4. **Broader Market Sentiment**: If the trust launch coincides with positive news about XRP or the broader crypto market, the trust could amplify any upward momentum in XRP’s price. Conversely, if the overall market is bearish, the trust might not have as strong an impact.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Impact**: In the short term, the announcement of the trust and the initial purchase of XRP for the trust could cause a price spike. In the long term, the price effect will depend on sustained interest from investors in the trust. If the trust attracts a lot of investment, the price of XRP could see steady growth.

Overall, while it's speculative, the Grayscale XRP Trust is likely to create upward pressure on the price of XRP, especially if it attracts significant investment from institutions and high-net-worth individuals. However, broader market conditions and other factors will also play a role in determining the actual price movement.",4

XRP,2024-12-04,post,Ripple,Should Ripple target EBay as a Partner or customer?,"eBay could potentially benefit from using Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency to reduce costs associated with cross-currency transactions. Here’s how XRP could help eBay cut costs:

~2mil USD in savings per 1 million transactions annually 

Reduced Transaction Fees
XRP transactions are extremely cost-effective, with the average transaction fee being only 0.00001 XRP (approximately $0.000005 at current rates). This is significantly lower than traditional payment processing fees, which could result in substantial savings for eBay and its users, especially for high-volume international transactions.

Faster Settlement Times
XRP transactions are processed and confirmed within 3-5 seconds on average. This rapid settlement could greatly improve eBay’s payment processing efficiency, reducing the time and resources needed for managing transactions.

Elimination of Nostro Accounts
By using XRP as a bridge currency, eBay could potentially eliminate the need for pre-funded nostro accounts in various currencies. This would free up capital and reduce the costs associated with maintaining multiple currency accounts for international transactions.

Enhanced Liquidity
XRP provides on-demand liquidity, which could significantly reduce liquidity costs for eBay. Ripple claims that using XRP can cut liquidity costs by up to 99%. This could be particularly beneficial for eBay’s cross-border transactions, allowing for more efficient use of capital.

Auto-Bridging Capability
XRP’s auto-bridging feature could automatically find the most cost-effective path for currency conversions. For example, if a user needs to convert USD to MXN, the system could automatically use XRP as an intermediary if it’s cheaper than direct conversion. This could result in better exchange rates for eBay users and potentially increase profit margins for the platform.

XRP,2024-11-19,post,Ripple,If.. if is good.,"Price Estimates in a CBDC Scenario
Moderate Adoption by a Few Countries:

If XRP is adopted by a small number of central banks as a bridge currency:
Price Range: $5–$10
Reasoning: Increased demand and speculation would significantly boost the price, but the scale of adoption would be limited.
Widespread Global Adoption of XRP for CBDCs:

If Ripple’s XRP becomes the backbone of CBDC interoperability globally:
Price Range: $20–$50
Reasoning: Ripple would see massive transaction volumes, with XRP’s utility increasing exponentially. This price range assumes that multiple central banks, large financial institutions, and remittance companies use XRP.
U.S. Government Adoption and Global Standardization:

If the U.S. government directly integrates Ripple's technology for its digital dollar and encourages global adoption:
Price Range: $100–$500+
Reasoning: A U.S.-backed endorsement would lead to XRP being viewed as a key asset in the new global financial system, much like gold or reserve currencies. This would trigger immense institutional and retail demand, coupled with massive utility.",37

XRP,2024-08-22,post,Ripple,Switzerland Instant Payments (bearish?),"Switzerland is using Six Group to facilitate instant payments. Six group is using SECOM Settlement and CLS Bank, neither use blockchain technology.  BIS put out a paper about this called ""Payment, clearing and settlement systems in Switzerland"" (https://www.bis.org/cpmi/paysys/switzerlandcomp.pdf).  I've dug as far as I can go and it seems that neither CLS Bank or SECOM use blockchain technology of any kind.  

Since instant (atomic) payments is just now going live and blockchain isn't utilized, it would be very bearish for crypto.

Can anybody find evidence of the blockchain being used here?

For example, a Democratic president recently sent money overseas for a war. I don’t fault him for it because, realistically, if no one defends those countries, we risk allowing their aggressors to continue seizing more territory. This could lead to a scenario reminiscent of Hitler's expansion, which no one wants to see repeated.

It came down to a choice: defend them now or let them be taken over, potentially becoming a greater threat in collaboration with powers like China. I don’t understand why people can’t grasp this perspective. Yes, it’s frustrating that we have homelessness and other issues here in America, yet billions are sent overseas. But unfortunately, this is how global politics and defense work. It’s a tough reality, much like the complexities of religion, for instance.",2
XRP,2024-12-23,comment,XRP,Comment on: Trump holds XRP...,"Dude, every ""fact"" you just laid out is textbook fake news. Let’s unpack this disaster:

1. Cold weather: It's real, congratulations on that groundbreaking discovery. What next, water is wet? That doesn’t disprove climate change, by the way.


2. Russia investigation: Yeah, it was real, and they did find evidence of interference. There was literally a whole Mueller report. Whether Trump understood it or not is a separate issue (spoiler: he probably didn’t).


3. BLM and Antifa: Antifa stands for “anti-fascist,” which honestly should be something everyone supports unless you're, well, a fascist. As for the $3 billion damage claim—you're really out here acting like they burned down Wall Street. Most protests happened in already marginalized areas, and those numbers are wildly exaggerated. Seriously, stop getting your stats from Facebook memes.


4. Economic blame game: The golden rule you missed is that the economy runs on lag. Good or bad, you usually credit the previous administration’s policies. Trump inherited an upward trajectory, took credit for it, and then left Biden to clean up the mess he left behind (see: pandemic mismanagement, record deficits, etc.). But yeah, let’s ignore that context, right?


5. Gas prices and inflation: During Trump’s first term, gas prices averaged about $2.49 per gallon—not exactly record lows, but his supporters acted like it was free. Inflation averaged 1.2%, which sounds good until you realize it was because the economy was sluggish, with stagnant wage growth for working people. Also, the pandemic tanked demand, not Trump’s genius policies. If you want to cherry-pick stats, at least get them right.


6. The wall that Mexico didn’t pay for: Speaking of hollow promises, remember when Trump swore Mexico would foot the bill for his wall? We’re still waiting for even a peso. Instead, U.S. taxpayers shelled out billions for a wall that’s more of a fence with huge gaps where people can just stroll through. Did anyone really think we were going to build a wall across the entire southern border? Trump probably doesn’t even know what “tariff” means, and I’d bet his supporters don’t either. They’ll find out soon enough when their $5 AliExpress socks turn into $50 thanks to his trade wars.


7. Gender and identity: Your fears about people living their authentic lives are so ridiculous they’re almost funny. Are you honestly terrified that someone in a bathroom might ""outsize"" you? Sounds like a personal problem, not a societal one. Live and let live—unless you’re worried a trans woman might outclass your masculinity, in which case, therapy could help.



And honestly, the irony of Trump supporters crying about “fake news” when their hero spent four years tweeting nonsense like “windmill cancer” is peak comedy. Instead of parroting his greatest hits, maybe try reading a book—or at least a fact-checker.",2

XRP,2025-01-21,post,XRP,XRP Market Cap to Price ,"Hello, Ive been seeing a lot of people in here that are new to Crypto and XRP and lots of crazy Price Predictions. There are lots of things in this sub reddit that are crazy and i want people to truly understand what it will take to reach prices from here. Ive held XRP for around 9 years and for me seeing it over $3 again is insane but i think we still have room to move up. - ( Disclaimer all math is a rough Calculation, and i understand why market cap might not be the best factor for calculating a ""Tokens"" value. But it is important and i thought people should understand this side of the equation as well. ) With that being said lets proceed.

**Current Price x Circulating Supply = Market Cap**

The Total Crypto Market Cap is $3.73 Trillion (every coin) Bitcoin (BTC) Makes up $2 Trillion of that Number.

XRP sits at #3 on the Charts at Currently $175b Market cap at a price of $3.05 (as of writing)

For a 2x from here we would need a $350b Market Cap would put the price around $6.10

Market Cap of ETH is $388B - IF Eth Does Not Move from here we would need XRP to be Around $6.72 for it to Flip ETH's Market Cap.

XRP at a $500 B Market Cap = Around $8.72

XRP at a $1T Market Cap = Around $17.5

XRP at BTC Market Cap 2T = Around $35

XRP at Total Crpto Market Cap 3.7T = Around $60

XRP at Golds Market Cap 18T (Most Valuable asset) = Around $315

Hope this gives people an idea of what the market cap of the token would need to be in order to achieve said prices.

Thanks,",334

XRP,2024-11-17,post,XRP,Realistic XRP Price Potential: $100+ or $10? Let’s Discuss,"Hey guys,

I'm an XRP holder since a while back. I've been following discussions about XRP, and I see some people throwing out crazy price predictions like $100 or even $500 per coin. I'd like to initiate a serious discussion about the true possibilities for such valuations.

When I do the calculations I get the following;

The market cap of XRP would be extremely high at $100 per coin. Market capitalisation is calculated as:

**Market Cap = Current Price × Circulating Supply**

As of now, XRP's circulating supply is around **57 billion coins** ([coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/)). At $100 per coin, the market cap would be:

100 × 57,000,000,000= **5.7 trillion USD** 

For perspective:

* This figure would surpass the current market capitalization of **all cryptocurrencies combined**, which is currently standing at **$3.18 Trillion** ([forbes](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/crypto-prices/?sh=64328a602478))
* This figure would be three times higher than the market capitalisation of BTC, which is currently standing at **$1.8 Trillion** ([forbes](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/crypto-prices/?sh=64328a602478))
* It would rival or exceed the GDP of major global economies.

Such a high market cap would then assume that XRP has achieved massive adoption and usage, potentially as a global reserve currency or a dominant settlement layer for cross-border payments. According to me, these are astronomically ambitious goals and require major changes in the global financial system.

The skepticism often lies in the feasibility of achieving such dominance, given the competition, regulatory hurdles, and adoption challenges. For XRP to hit $100 or more, it would need demand and utility on an unprecedented scale, and arguments for this scenario usually involve replacing or heavily disrupting systems like SWIFT or gaining widespread global adoption for remittance and banking settlements.

**Why $3–$4 Is More Realistic**

On the other hand, a price range of $3–$4 seems much more achievable, considering the past performance of XRP and its ongoing developments. At these price levels, the market cap would be between $170 billion and $230 billion, which is comparable to Ethereum's historical highs during the last bull market. Achieving these prices would likely depend on factors such as regulatory clarity, increased adoption of RippleNet's On-Demand Liquidity solutions, and a broader crypto bull market.

**Conclusion**

I want to open a serious discussion about XRP's potential. While extreme predictions like $100 or $500 seem far-fetched, I'd be glad to hear other's opinions on the matter (obv such price ranges would be amazing).

Cheers!",102

So, it stands to reason $3-4 was be on a lower scale. SWIFT moves around $150 TRILLION per year. If XRP were to replace that the demand would be much greater than what we saw in 2016. Obviously, there are forces at play to prevent XRP from being used on a massive scale. To me that’s the biggest risk. Someone stands to lose their golden goose. I believe that’s why the SEC sued Ripple: it caught them off guard and they needed time to find/build their own competitive product.",52

What about 10 years from now? What future use-cases and wide-scale adoption of the currency might influence its price, volatility, liquidity, etc? 

Others have already mentioned the prospect of XRP as a replacement to SWIFT, which would mean XRP has to move trillions of $ in daily volume. Currently, XRP is averaging around $11 billion daily volume at a price of $1. If the full 100 billion quantity were actually in circulation then is $20-$30 billion daily volume a reasonable estimate for today? Even then, it’s at least 100s of times less volume compared to what SWIFT moves daily. Thus, the price has to make up for that figure. 

SWIFT is only one potential use-case for a digital currency. There are others and every token is vying for them. It seems XRP is a great candidate on paper, albeit still contending.",4

XRP,2025-01-29,post,XRP,XRP Lawsuit News: Ripple CLO Says Case Will Be Withdrawn By SEC Under Atkins in 2025,"AS WE ALL EXPECTED 

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, has expressed optimism that the future leadership of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could shift the trajectory of the company’s ongoing legal battle. Specifically, he hopes that Paul Atkins, nominated by Donald Trump to lead the SEC, might take a more lenient stance towards crypto companies, possibly dismissing enforcement actions based solely on registration issues rather than fraud.

 In a January 28 discussion for XRP Community Day 2025, Alderoty acknowledged the SEC’s bureaucratic nature and expressed his hope that under Atkins, the commission might focus on fraud-related cases.

“Litigation, regulation by enforcement, is not the path that this country should be pursuing. I believe the new SEC understands that, and I remain cautiously optimistic that at some point during 2025, the case will be voluntarily withdrawn,” he said.

The Senate has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for Atkins, but if he assumes the role, Alderoty believes that the SEC could back away from civil suits against crypto firms, especially those where the main concern is a lack of registration. Ripple, which is currently involved in a lawsuit with the SEC over the classification of its XRP token as an unregistered security, has been in legal limbo since December 2020.

The case has seen significant developments, including a federal judge ruling in August 2024 that Ripple was liable for over $125 million. Both Ripple and the SEC have filed appeals, with Ripple contesting the decision. The outcome of the SEC’s leadership transition could significantly impact Ripple’s legal landscape and its future with the agency.",351

Basically, Bitcoin dominance has not topped out yet. Not until it tops out will you see any movement with alt coins.

It's best to hold Bitcoin until that happens, then you sell out of Bitcoin and buy your favorite alts.

It's important to understand you don't hold the alt coins long though, only through the current cycle. Rinse and repeat, the end goal is just to accumulate more Bitcoin.",2
XRP,2025-02-03,post,XRP,99% of this sub needs to stop.,"Let me preface this by saying I’ve been holding XRP since 2017 and have only added to my position. With that being said, a lot of you post the dumbest shit on this subreddit and it’s enough to absolutely drive anybody away who has ever heard of XRP and would like more info and finds themselves on this sub. Nobody cares that you bought 14 more XRP. Nobody gives a shit that you think the coin is going to $10,000 per coin and you’re going to be a billionaire. Nobody fucking cares whether you’re diamond hands or paper hands or somewhere in between. You guys are doing an absolutely horrific job of providing anything remotely useful for someone to make an EDUCATED decision on whether they would like to take a position in XRP or not. 

This place is a constant circle jerk of the stupidest posts I’ve ever seen. Post some fucking news articles, some facts, something with some merit. Nobody outside of this circle jerk will ever take XRP seriously if all this sub ever consists of is trust me bro posts and comparing wallet sizes, talking about how you’re going to be the next Saudi oil prince with the 26 XRP you have. I, and what should be 100 percent of every other person who visits this sub, will NOT add to my position because you had a dream that your chakras aligned and you saw a penny heads up on your walk today. 

This place gives me the same feeling as the AMC subreddit and I wouldn’t blame anybody who is slightly interested in XRP to run for the hills after looking at this place. Do every body a favor and quit this shit. Give people a reason to give a shit about XRP. Your thoughts, hopes, and dreams don’t need their own post.

This will be achieved by the dismissal of the SEC case once trump gets into power. 

Upon dismissal financial institutions will begin buying up XRP, including SBI in Japan, South Korean FIs, UAE FIs, Santander etc. 

This drive in adoption partnered with Ripple continuing to successfully partner with more institutions throughout 2025, particularly now in the US where they have been stiffled by Gensler will see the price steadily rise to $8 by EOY and potentially flip ETH for 2nd Spot crypto.

Continued adoption through 2026 - 2030 and we will start seeing double figures.

XRP,2024-09-05,post,XRP,Bullish case for XRP,"So bear with me… its my honest opinion that this time next week we will have an announcement that the SEC will file an appeal in their lawsuit against Ripple, and I for one couldn’t be happier!

Obviously I’d hoped this would have been wrapped up years ago and XRP was allowed to run on its merry way to the top of the pile already, but sadly the SEC and the central banks funding them haven’t allowed this to happen… yet?! 

To me, this lawsuit has represented nothing more than smoke and mirrors, a stage in which to show the world their ability to slow this asset down until they are all ready!! And believe me they are nearly ready! 

Don’t you find it almost hilarious, the timing at which all this is taken place?? The fact the lawsuit is being dragged on for probably another year, just in time for the major banks and financial institutions to start re-allocating their assets in order to front run the explosion that’s about to occur… just in time for the Fed to pivot and cut rates, also allowing institutions to free up capital in order to get ahead once this thing pops!! 

It’s all timing, it’s all planned… it’s all coming to us, we just have to be patient a little while longer, because this appeal will be the biggest (possibly last) shake out of weak hands there has been so far!! This lawsuit for me, confirms I am in the right position, that we hold the right asset. If it was all made easy for us, I’d be extremely worried! HODL XRP ARMY - good luck",157

XRP,2024-09-06,comment,XRP,Comment on: Bullish case for XRP...,"The banks and institutions dont care about the price being low for accumulation. There is only so high a price retail can push XRP and that price point is definitely not high enough for banks/institutions to delay for so long that it starts affecting even them. Japan and Korea will be using XRP next year, there are plenty of other businesses and banks that will be using it along side them that aren't in the US, because remember: the US isn't the only fucking place using XRP and this lawsuit applies specifically to the US.

To say that they are gonna drag it out another year is ludicrous. When the other banks and institutions of the world start using it properly sometime next year, if they drag the case on, the banks and institutions of America will miss out. and also, the timing could not be better for them to finally end the court case here and now. Regulations are flowing in, presidential election uncertainty is being priced in, the rest of the world will start using the XRPL and by extension XRP, and so when you talk about them delaying another year, it is just simply preposterous.

My two-cents is that the SEC won't appeal, and the 1700-something NDA's that ripple already has most likely already involve institutional sales to various US-based bidders which once the SEC doen't appeal, will go through as they have already been planning for likely the last 4 years.

Now is the time for institutional adoption, not in a year or two. Also the XRP 4-year bull pennant will be invalidated if the price is suppressed for any longer.",10

XRP,2025-05-12,comment,XRP,Comment on: My take on xrp price for long run...,"Here is my issue with this. Ripple holds 40 billion coins and they say they release 1 billion per month, but in reality they usually sell off 300m or so and put the other 700m back in escrow. It’s going to take many years for them to get everything into circulation. 

Why does this matter? Because the big players with money really like their power and will not shift all that money and power to ripple that easily. 

If it shot up to $500 while ripple holds 40 billion coins they would be sitting on 20 trillion dollars in their escrow. To put that into perspective they would be able to buy Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvida and Google and still have around 5 trillion left in their account. 

I understand the whole “market cap doesn’t matter for a utility”. I’m not in total disagreement with that, but I don’t think we see those high numbers unless all coins are in circulation and it needs to be adopted by most of the major institutions. Those prices only happen if the institutions need the supply that’s in the hands of retail. That demand will drive prices. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong. If someone sees this differently please enlighten me. 

Realistic bull prediction for me would be $10 by 2030. Still a good investment. I do belive in XRP and will continue to buy, but I think these predictions are crazy sometimes.",14

Does anybody study BTC price movements? 

Big things will happen next year because of Trumps inauguration and all of his policies on tariffs and intentions to let government influence the cash rate. 

Apparently none of this will be good for the economy. Thus a considerable dip next year is expected.

Judge did order a $125M penalty for XRP to pay but we will see what that looks with the new SEC administration.

They can do this many times a day because it will settled in seconds instead of days. Also it will be very cheap for them to do so.

Most likely it will follow the crowd, and just have a smaller correction than most. But possibly,  if the bear cycle comes during the height of growth, accumulation, and adoption for xrp. Theoretically we could see it just steady grow through the bear market as everything else corrects because no one wants to miss the boat on world wide financial change. But once every government and institution has what it wants and what it needs to function on/in the new system, and it has essentially reached saturation, it won't ever do that again. And it will just follow the flow of bears and bulls but at staggeringly new heights. That is at least my opinion of the situation.",8

XRP,2024-12-15,post,XRP,XRP: The Most Obvious Analysis Ever,"
Good morning, fellow XRP watchers and hopeless coffee addicts! Let’s dive deep into the groundbreaking analysis of XRP’s daily chart. Spoiler: You might want to sit down for my 100% guaranteed prediction at the end.

The 4-hour chart is tighter than my jeans after the holidays. XRP is chilling in the neutral zone—too lazy to go up, too tired to fall down. It’s like that awkward guy at a party who’s just standing by the snack table, not quite sure what to do next.

On the daily chart, XRP is oversold. Way oversold. Like, “couldn’t pay its rent” oversold. Usually, that’s when the bulls start waking up, rub their eyes, and push the price up—usually. Or maybe they’ll just hit snooze again.

The MACD is “rounding the bottom” like a perfectly poured cappuccino. The red bars are fading, which means the reversal could be cooking. Slowly. Like a frozen pizza you forgot in the oven at 200°.

Now let’s talk about the Stochastic RSI. It’s practically lying face-down at rock bottom. Imagine someone so exhausted they’re just crawling across the gym floor saying, “I’ll move up soon, I swear.” The indicators want XRP to move, but they’re not in a rush.

Volume is light right now, but big volume could be incoming any moment. When the whales decide to jump in, we’ll know because they never leave quietly. It’ll be more like, “Hey, you awake? BOOM. We’re moving.”

Now, for my 100% GUARANTEED PREDICTION—this is the one you’ve been waiting for:

XRP will go up, down, or sideways. That’s right. I said it. It’s the kind of insight you only get here.

To sum it up, XRP’s next move is as clear as mud. The indicators look ready, the market looks sleepy, and I look like someone who hasn’t left the charts in days. Remember: sideways is still a direction, and “soon” is the favorite word in crypto.

Good luck out there—see you at the top, the bottom, or the same place we started. 🚀",230

There is still a sense of unpredictability in the air due to america politics and tarrifs being announced this week so I'm not expecting a break out to $3 anytime soon. It might even shoot us back down more so I'm going to liquidate some holdings.

Not financial advice but it seems like a good short buy and quick profit this week for me at least

XRP,2024-07-19,post,XRP,"Scenario: We wake up and XRP is flying, we've out valued ETH and we're heading to £10k. What do you do next?","Long term (hopeful and expectant) plan for XRP
Caveat: I don't need or have any desire to be wildly wealthy, just to have a big enough nestegg to provide an unsurpassable buffer for a person who does not live extravagantly.
Caveat 2: I have a plan to HODL for passive gains if return on utility outpaces monetary value.
Caveat 3: If there comes a need to diversify, land purchase and property is an option I'll be considering.
With all that given, here's my very simple dream scenario;
 
1. Wait for XRP to hit £10k
2. Withdraw my small holding then valued at £13M
3. Pay 45% on the whole lot
4. Put my circa £7M into high yield
5. Quit soul-sucking job (no, I don't do that sort of soul sucking, you naughty people!)
6. Live comfortably off the interest of £420k+ annually
7. Contain my spending to ensure compounding growth through to my kids and grandkids.
8. Never work for a business I don't own again.

Whats everyone else doing??

Current market cap is 197billion. 

worldwide transactional volume is about 1.7quadrillion per year. 
At a burn rate of 0.00001 xrp per transaction, 
IFF it became the cornerstone of the financial markets then we would burn roughly 17billion XRP per year. 

Let's assume there is a minimum supply of 1 billion coins. 
A market cap that runs up to 10trillion.

XRP,2025-01-17,comment,XRP,"Comment on: The math on $10,000/XRP...","Alright here me out.

Your burn rate calculation is overestimated.

The XRP burn rate per transaction is currently 0.00001 XRP, but this fee is dynamic and can increase during network congestion or decrease if usage is low.

Assuming all $1.7 quadrillion in global transactions run through XRP is highly unrealistic. Not all financial transactions would rely solely on XRP, even if RippleNet became widely adopted.

At the stated burn rate, to burn 17 billion XRP per year, the network would need 1.7 quadrillion transactions annually, not $1.7 quadrillion in value. The calculation confuses transaction count with transaction volume.

Your supply reduction to 1 Billion is unrealistic.

XRP’s burn mechanism is designed to prevent network spam, not to significantly reduce supply.

To burn 58 billion XRP down to 1 billion would take far longer than 3–4 years under realistic transaction volumes.

Ripple’s escrow releases 1 billion XRP monthly, and unused XRP is returned to escrow. This controls supply but doesn't directly impact the burn rate.

Yes, I would LOVE to see a $10K XRP but please look at the fundamentals and realistic expectations.",104

XRP,2025-01-17,comment,XRP,"Comment on: The math on $10,000/XRP...","Its more simple then that.

  
There are not enough xrp coins to process that kind of volume in increments of $10, $100, or even $1,000 valuation.

  
It takes 3-5 seconds to do a transaction at 1,500 transactions a second. 

  
There are 86,000 seconds in a day. divide by 3 that's 28,800 3 second gaps capable of a transaction times 1,500 transactions leaves 43,200,000 transactions a day. Times $1,000 that means XRP can only process $43,200,000,000 at a coin valuation of $1,000 per coin

  
XRP price needs to be much higher than where we are now just to handle the volume they are going to be handling on a daily basis.

  
We haven't even added tokenization to the calculations yet either. What happens to the price when every square mile of property in the world is tokenized? Every pallet shipped anywhere?

XRP,2025-04-22,post,XRP,Use of Same XRP Token every 5 Seconds and Impact on Price,"Genuine question and apologies if it's been asked before, I'm hoping I'm just missing something obvious.

Why does each xrp token unit price need to be so high when the same token can be used every 3-5 seconds?

There are 86,400 seconds in 24 hrs.
86,400 ÷ 5 (seconds) =17,280.
In theory, could $1 billion xrp at $1 each move back and forth 17,280 times to transfer $1.728 trillion over a 24-hour period?
By this theory, only $3 billion worth of xrp could process SWIFTS $5 trillion a day.

I know this is a simplistic example, and it requires a 100% efficient market, but even if the market is only 10% efficient, does it mean $1billion worth of xrp could technically bridge $172.8 billion every 24 hrs.

I am pro xrp, but this has been bugging me, and I hope someone here can debunk the theory very quickly.

XRP,2025-04-22,comment,XRP,Comment on: Use of Same XRP Token every 5 Seconds and Impact o...,"Let’s say Institution A needs to send $3 billion USD to Japan:


Step 1: Buy XRP


Institution A uses an exchange or liquidity provider to instantly buy $3 billion worth of XRP at the current market price.


If XRP is $1: they buy 3 billion XRP


If XRP is $200: they buy 15 million XRP (So they buy fewer tokens if the price is higher — but the value stays the same.)


Step 2: Send XRP


They send that XRP across the XRP Ledger — the transaction settles in about 3 to 5 seconds.


Transaction fee: around 0.00001 XRP (fractions of a penny)


Step 3: Convert to JPY


Once the XRP arrives on the other side (say, a Japanese bank or exchange), it’s instantly converted into Japanese Yen using a local liquidity provider.


Key Point:


They never hold XRP. It’s used only in transit, for seconds, to bridge USD to JPY (or any other currency pair that lacks a direct or cheap route.


So Why Doesn’t the Price of XRP Matter to Them?


Because the value they’re moving is the same regardless of XRP’s price. It’s like converting $3 billion into any intermediary — whether it’s 3 billion bananas or 15 million gold bars — as long as they instantly convert back into money on the other side, the total cost stays low and there’s no exposure to price swings.


What actually does matter to them:


Speed


Low fees


Liquidity (Can they get in and out of XRP quickly without slippage?)

Traders will always buy low and sell high.

Example 

You started buying ripple at .50 cents and you spent $1000 on it.

So you got 2000 ripple at an average cost of 50 cents and you held it until it reached a value of $3.00

2000 x $3.00 = $6000

So your profit was $5000 on a $1000 initial investment.

Now you have $5000 liquidity to play with and you can buy back in when it dips and sell when it goes back up or take the money and run.

Big whales are basically adding more zeros to this and doing it every day/week. You spent $1000 and made $5000. A whale could have spent $100,000 and made $500,000 doing the same style trade.

XRP,2025-02-04,post,XRP,Major XRP bearishness is great news.........,"We know that most retail traders and position holders are incredibly prone to fear and greed, and therefore are often likely to abandon their positions the deeper the dip runs. Sure, there are a portion of retail traders that acquire more positions, but many do not, and even sell their lot entirely, which leads me to the most important aspect of bearishness........

More institutional money replacing the positions of the weak retail holders is what the market *needs* to drive price to the desired place we all want it to go. In theory, we should all be hoping for institutional dominance of this market. We should have hoping that more and more people like *us* (single person portfolio) are squeezed out in favour of big financial and institutional money...........so long as *we* who remain are still holding positions.

XRP,2024-11-30,post,XRP,Can someone tell me why RLUSD approval would be bullish for XRP?,"This is a genuine question. Dont get me wrong. XRP takes up 70% of my crypto portfolio and I'm concerned. Once RLUSD is out, the financial institutions can as well leverage that for international money transfers instead of XRP isnt it? By definition, RLUSD would be much more stable than XRP. So would that not diminish XRP's use case and potentially harm its demand and price? If am right here, will the release of RLUSD lead to a sell off event for XRP?",47
XRP,2024-11-30,comment,XRP,Comment on: Can someone tell me why RLUSD approval would be bu...,"XRP is the bridge.

Lets say Mr Smih wants to send 1mil USD to his mrs in japan. His bank needs to hold both currencies to make the transaction. 

Instead of the transaction between currencies requiring (example) 1million USD AND 1million euros, now the transaction requires 1million USD  and 1million XRP (at a dollar for ease of understanding). Whilst in transit, the million XRP is essentially the 1million USD. 

This is a big deal. 180 currencies in the world (over 6000 currency combos) only need to hold 1 bridge instead of 6000. 

RLUSD simply digitises the dollar with the confidence that it is regulated and backed 1:1. It means i can purchase RLUSD with cash at the bank then use that in the digital ecosystem (XRP ledger and ethereum currently).",43

XRP,2024-11-30,comment,XRP,Comment on: Can someone tell me why RLUSD approval would be bu...,"I understand the concern here. RLUSD could reduce XRP demand in some use cases. For example, institutions might prefer a stable asset like RLUSD for certain transactions. However, this depends on whether RLUSD can provide the same level of cost savings and efficiency as XRP in illiquid corridors.

Ripple would likely position RLUSD as part of a broader ecosystem where XRP still plays a critical role. If RLUSD gains significant traction and diminishes XRP’s demand, there could be a sell-off, but this scenario depends heavily on how Ripple markets and integrates the two assets.

RLUSD, as a stablecoin, should complement XRP rather than replace it. Stablecoins are excellent for reducing volatility in payments and providing liquidity in corridors where fiat pairs are well-supported. However, XRP’s value lies in its ability to bridge illiquid currency pairs and provide instant settlement in cross-border payments, especially in corridors where fiat or stablecoin liquidity is insufficient.

In this context, RLUSD could help onboard more financial institutions to RippleNet by providing a familiar stable asset while still relying on XRP for bridging where necessary. This could increase overall adoption of the Ripple ecosystem, indirectly benefiting XRP.",7

XRP,2025-02-10,comment,XRP,Comment on: Can someone tell me why RLUSD approval would be bu...,"I'm conversant in Economics and wholesale Banking but very very brand new to Crypto.  

Let me explain why I think XRP may still be useful in transactions.  Tell me if I'm right or wrong:

I need to send a substantial sum from California (where I bank in dollars) to my Indian office, who does business in Rupees.

Nowadays it's slow and expensive and fraught with angst to send big sums.  If I do this a lot I need a whole desk devoted to untangling the squabbling snakes in the transaction bag. I love the Ripple solution!

Instead, I just buy XRP.  Let's suppose that my purchase is enough to move the XRP market needle, so I get my first trade price cheaper than my last trade price and then I bang the sum over into RUSD at the last trade price.  This happens in the blink of an eye and doesn't affect the value of either(?). Does Ripple plan on an Algorythm selling XRP for RUSD to stay stable? If my trade was big enough to lift the XRP price, will the equal and opposite Algo trade crater it just as much?  

I now have spare XRP, or RUSD if my purchase was big enough to spike the market and I decided caution was the better part of valor and moved the excess over to stable. I get that's why to buy and then snap it over to stable. 

In seconds, my Indian vendor has a confirmed transfer of Dollars in their Bank of India account.  YAY!  Ripple Labs for the win!

Do they swap it for XRP and sell it for market?  Sell the RUSD for rupees?  What's the spread on that? 

Big question:  Do I HAVE to buy XRP or can we consider that step superfluous and just by a stable coin operating on a Ripple platform?  If so, how does XRP benefit (price and volume and market cap-wise) at all? 

The well informed will see that I'm asking lots of questions and not at all antagonistic.  I have learned a lot from this thread alone and am just asking for some more clarity.  I don't do Forex or Money Markets or wires so I'm quite a bit behind the curve.....",1

XRP,2025-01-09,post,XRP,How would banks make the price of XRP go up?,"I asked this question earlier and got a decent answer (link below). BUT I’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts and opinions.

The common XRP bullish argument I hear is.. “If enough banks utilize XRP, the price will have to go up”. Which makes sense, somewhat.. SWIFT transacts 150 Trillion per year, if XRP even did a third of that volume let’s say 50 trillion yearly. The current circulating supply of 57 billion XRP is not nearly enough to meet that demand at its current price point of $2.31. Right?

My question is.. Isn’t this argument assuming that banks are going to hold XRP? Wouldn’t they need to hold in order to add any liquidity? In my opinion, it doesn’t seem likely that banks would hold any large amounts because XRP and crypto in general is too volatile for them. Banks are likely to use XRP for cross border payments (what it’s designed for) for example USD>XRP>JPY. If that is the case, wouldn’t the main source of liquidity always be retail investors aka us? Pls tell me I’m missing something 

edit; I found a thread answered by David Schwartz that is helpful.

XRP,2025-01-09,comment,XRP,Comment on: How would banks make the price of XRP go up?...,"Banks are already holding XRP, Can’t specify which, but as far as I know, they’re buying large amounts of XRP directly from Ripple (OTC - Over the Counter). When purchased this way, the price of XRP on the market doesn’t change. When banks officially start to use the market for purchases , the price will rise because they will be buying large amounts to facilitate their transactions across the networks.",30
XRP,2025-01-09,comment,XRP,Comment on: How would banks make the price of XRP go up?...,"My understanding... 

Hiro in Japan wants to send 10mil yen to Boris in Russia.   
Hiro's bank buys 10mil yen worth of XRP using Hiro's funds (this removes XRP from the market).  
The XRP is sent from Hiro's bank XRP wallet to Boris's bank XRP wallet.  
Boris's bank sells the XRP for Rubles (this releases the XRP back into the market).

The main point -- the bank won't use their own money to buy the XRP for the transfer, they will use Hiro's yen -- the bank is just processing and guaranteeing completion of the transaction (if anything goes wrong in processing, the bank stands good for the transaction). So the XRP is only tied up for the duration of the transaction. Hiro's money isn't tied up any longer than necessary and only needs to exit his interest bearing account at the last moment.

Plus Ripple has a liquidity pool (the escrowed XRP) that can be used like a shock absorber to throttle liquidity up/down as needed by demand. So I don't see banks sitting on piles of XRP in hopes a customer will want to avail themselves of the new transfer method. If they are allowed to, I could see them buying XRP right now for the same reasons \*we\* are -- speculation in anticipation of a rising price.

This is just my best guess. If anyone has any insight into the actual nuts & bolts process, I would be interested in hearing it.",11

XRP,2025-01-09,comment,XRP,Comment on: How would banks make the price of XRP go up?...,Simplest way to move large amounts of money cross border with lower fees is XRP raising in value to handle the load. It doesn’t work if XRP is $2 with that supply number,9
XRP,2025-01-10,comment,XRP,Comment on: How would banks make the price of XRP go up?...,"It seems like not many people here understand what XRP is or how its price will increase.

XRP is a utility token designed to facilitate global payment transactions between parties A and B on the XRP network.

Here’s how it works:
	1.	The sender’s RLUSD stablecoin is converted into XRP to transfer the payment to the recipient.
	2.	Upon reaching the recipient’s account, the XRP is converted back into RLUSD stablecoin.

During each transaction, a small amount of XRP is burned — permanently removed from circulation. The current burn rate is 0.00001 XRP per transaction, reducing the available supply over time.

With trillions of global transactions occurring daily, this burn mechanism decreases supply while demand is expected to rise, following the basic principles of supply and demand.

Currently, many financial institutions use the older SWIFT system, which requires them to maintain Nostro and Vostro accounts — stores of pre-funded cash held in foreign currencies — to facilitate global payments. However, with XRP’s nearly instant settlement capabilities, these accounts become unnecessary, freeing up billions in liquidity.

Think of XRP like electricity:
	•	When you turn on a light, the electricity used can’t be reused.
	•	Similarly, once XRP facilitates a payment, the portion used is gone forever.

Because XRP provides real utility, financial institutions are increasingly inclined to adopt it for their payment networks. Its speed and efficiency make it a game-changer, potentially transforming the global payments landscape.",8

XRP,2025-01-10,comment,XRP,Comment on: How would banks make the price of XRP go up?...,"How I understand it is XRP is a store of value but also the processing mechanism for the ledger to work optimally . 

Banks that deal heavily in remittances are forced to encumber trillions in no/vo  accounts to ensure  payment . High transaction volume causes congestion and takes more time and energy (fee) effectively reducing their ability to free up capital  . 

Assuming regulatory clarity and Mass adoption of  XRP to process transactions more quickly .. (3-5seconds )banks will be able to clear billions in encumbrances and put it back on their books by rocketing payments through the XRPL that would otherwise be idle . 

XRPL can become congested and requires a higher fee for priority processing in those cases. 
The higher the price of an XRP the more scalability 
And ODL it holds . 10-ish drops is the fee no matter if the transaction is valued at 1$ or 1million$ not a % . Bankers will make more money long term that way by keeping the money that was  tied up moving . 

I think .. I stress think ..Banks will take the volatility as long as very deep liquidity pools are readily available .. amm’s and alike can stabilize price long while adoption continues  .. Ripple IPO will be great for XRP .. RLusd/jpy/gbp .. ect . All signals future green candles .

I'm thinking we will hit another bitcoin all time high around the same time we have before

(March-June) 1 year after the bitcoin halving)

I'm thinking we will se another all time high for XRP and most other crypto.

Thoughts?

(Regardless boys, bag up XRP for that time period. There is money to be made according to historical price data and for long time holders as well)",51

When it comes to crypto, say you already have your base amount invested in XRP, anything new you put in would be like taking profits I assume if price increases. 


Say you put in a few hundred and the price increases, do you or anyone else cash out on the few hundred you put in + the profits and then wait for it to drop down again and reinvest that capital?  


How does that work out when it's tax time the following year? Are investors manually deducting their taxes from the profits and putting it aside for tax time the next year?

What I’m more interested in is David Schwartz and Brad Garlinghouse’s take on price

“It *can’t* be dirt cheap. That doesn’t make any sense. If XRP costs $1, they’d need a million XRP which would cost $1 million. If XRP cost a million dollars, they’d need one XRP which would, again, cost $1 million.” 1/2

“Except that higher prices make payments cheaper. Right now, you can buy a million dollar house with bitcoins. When bitcoins where $300, it would move the market too much and be too expensive to be practical. So higher prices make payments cheaper.” 2/2

Copy and pasted from David’s X post. He knows he can’t state a price (even though he most likely has a range in his mind while writing this). It’s up to you to decide what “cheap” and “higher prices” mean",5

It JUST DEPENDS how fast all the global financial institutions adopt XRP for transactions.  Those institutions NEED XRP to be above $25+++ for their transactions to be “fee free” every 3 seconds.  Otherwise they have to buy XRP, pay the fees in real time transactions.

That’s why the biggest global financial institutions are the whales 🐳 for XRP today.  The higher XRP goes, the less they pay in fees for global transactions in the future.

With that said….  $27 would be extremely low in the next few years!

*. Edit ✍️:  watch BTC’s growth, watch the market cap MC,  XRP will NEVER 👎 beat BTC’s MC… but it will closely follow it.  YOU do the math 🧮!!   Based on today’s MC for BTC and XRP….then when BTC hits $1 million… what would XRP be?  That’s how, when and what XRP will be worth!!

If/when Ripple goes public, I can double dip on the profits as I currently invest in BKCH, a blockchain ETF that doesn't invest in crypto, but rather the companies that are developing tech and solutions based on the underlying blockchain. No doubt BKCH will add Ripple to their portfolio. Additionally, I believe the IPO will also increase the value of XRP, so both my 401K and my crypto portfolio will go up.

  
As to how much XRP will be worth, I don't know. What's bitcoin used for? Anyone know? Does the bitcoin blockchain offer any value? Last I checked, bitcoin blockchain can't be used for things like smart contracts. Also very power hungry. But it is secure and truly decentralized. So over the next few years, it's up to the free markets to determine which blockchains have the most value, and I argue that XRP has several advantages over bitcoin. So, investors may begin to switch over, driving up demand. Demand up, price up. But that's just one scenario and in a free market, there are no guarantees.",3

XRP,2024-12-15,post,XRP,Do Banks and other institutions need to hold XRP for the price to go up???,"NEED ANSWER, PLEASE HELP.

I believe from researching that XRP will be used for cross-border payments mainly which means instead of banks and institutions holding different currencies in their account they can hold XRP in their accounts instead of doing  foreign currency transactions for different countries. for example, if a bank in Hong Kong does business All over the world with 20 countries, they don't have to hold 20 different currencies, they only need to hold XRP. They can calculate what they need to send in XRP and send it immediately and cheaply.

BUT WHY WILL THE PRICE OF XRP INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IF BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS DON'T NEED TO ""HOLD"" XRP WHEN THEY CAN JUST TRANSACT FOR JUST SECONDS. They would use their own country's currency to buy XRP and send to another country who will immediately convert to their own currency,  which means noone is holding XRP.
Example:
Sender
Convert USD - XRP
Receiver 
Convert XRP - EUR

Who is holding for the XRP price to go up?",11

XRP,2024-12-15,comment,XRP,Comment on: Do Banks and other institutions need to hold XRP f...,"I get where the confusion comes from—if XRP is just a “bridge” that institutions use briefly, why would the price appreciate?

The key is understanding that for XRP to work as a global liquidity bridge, there needs to be *deep, stable liquidity* in the markets where it’s traded. This isn’t just about a single transaction from USD to EUR; it’s about an entire ecosystem of market makers, traders, and yes, even financial institutions that find it cost-effective to keep reserves of XRP on hand. Without someone holding it, the liquidity would be too shallow, spreads too high, and slippage too severe, which defeats the purpose of cost-efficient cross-border settlements.

From what I’ve learned (and firmly believe), as adoption scales—especially if XRP becomes the universal “oil” greasing the gears of global finance—different players will have strong incentives to hold at least some XRP long-term:

1. **Market Makers and Liquidity Providers:** These participants need to hold XRP inventories to provide constant two-way quotes. They make their profit on the spread, and to ensure instant conversions, they must keep XRP on their books. If the volume of global cross-border transactions passing through XRP grows, they’ll need larger inventories, increasing overall demand.
2. **Corporate and Institutional Treasuries:** While banks and institutions can technically just flip in and out of XRP, many will realize cost efficiencies by holding XRP directly, at least in some corridors. For multinational corporations (think Apple or Seagate), holding one asset (XRP) to facilitate multiple global payouts is more efficient than maintaining 20 different currency accounts (Why XRP Will Increase in Value; Ripple’s Strategy to Boost XRP Adoption). Over time, as liquidity improves and volatility stabilizes, keeping a buffer of XRP becomes more attractive—this is how it starts to behave like a store of value.
3. **Network Effects and the Virtuous Cycle:** As detailed in the Fair Market Value of XRP scenarios, once adoption passes a certain threshold, the demand for XRP as a liquidity token and store of value can grow exponentially. The Virtuous Cycle concept suggests that the more it’s used, the more valuable and stable it becomes, which in turn makes it more appealing to hold. This creates positive feedback loops where more participants hold XRP to ensure fast, cheap transfers and to hedge against increasing usage costs.
4. **Speculators and Investors:** Beyond institutional usage, there’s a broader market—retail investors, hedge funds, and crypto asset managers—that will hold XRP if they believe in its long-term role as global financial plumbing. As regulatory clarity improves and Ripple’s enterprise solutions gain traction, confidence grows, and more participants hold XRP as a long-term strategic asset, not just a transaction tool.

So even though each individual cross-border payment might involve holding XRP for only seconds, the collective impact of a global network using XRP for liquidity means large pools of it must be held in anticipation of that flow. Over time, this drives demand higher than supply, pushing up the price. It’s not about one bank holding XRP forever—it’s about the entire ecosystem finding value in having XRP readily available, reinforcing its role not only as a bridge currency but eventually as a store of value asset.",14

This comment by [Imaginary\_Ad5147](https://www.reddit.com/user/Imaginary_Ad5147/) should sum it up for you :)

Sometimes I get tired of this question being asked over and over again, but this is the place to do it. It’s good you’re asking in a genuine way because a lot of times it’s worded poorly and the informed people here don’t want to answer. I hope this clarifies how xrp works:

Let’s say $100 billion needs to be moved by banks through the use of xrp. There are 100 billion tokens. That means at $1 they would need to use all 100 billion tokens in existence. Let’s say we factor in available tokens of the circulating supply (not held by retail, banks, institutions, etfs, etps, and ripple etc) now we get a much smaller number. Let’s say 50 billion circ supply goes down to 30 billion. Now that $1 xrp is now $3. Now let’s say banks are moving on the ledger what swift moves in a day which is $5 trillion. This is the milestone many in the community look towards. That $3 token is now $133

JP Morgan facilitates $10 trillion worth of payments per day. Their MC is not $10 trillion. If a token were used to facilitate these payments, and there were 50 billion of these tokens available how much would that token need to be worth to move that amount of money? $200. What about 40B tokens, 30B, 25B, you get the idea. Banks won’t sell any tokens being used for payments, just to buy them back again for payments. So those tokens are just being circulated within the ecosystem, forever shrinking due to burning. The top 5 banks in the US move approx $40T a day. That’s just the US. $50T @ 25B available tokens is $2k a token

I am not saying xrp will be at a circulating supply of 25B and will be moving $50T. This is just easy numbers to explain the mechanics of how xrp can scale to large amounts in order to move money around the world. I think the next two years will be very interesting in the utility space, with the big winners being xrp as well as a handful of others that offer true utility and value. We have never had price action due to utility and not trading volume, but I believe it will shatter most of the current thoughts on crypto, and the role of MC and supply

RWA tokenization is a whole nother beast, and is over $2 quadrillion, which the XRPL is expected to gain a market share of. That’s probably better left for another post. Best of luck",3
XRP,2024-12-15,comment,XRP,Comment on: Do Banks and other institutions need to hold XRP f...,"The low transaction settlement costs associated with XRP will significantly increase its demand. Even if the price rises as a result of increased demand, the utility of XRP in providing fast, low-cost cross-border payments will likely outweigh the price increase. This makes XRP an attractive option for institutions, who would continue using it for its efficiency and cost-saving benefits. This is the key driver for adoption. XRP operates with a deflationary mechanism. As the price of XRP increases, the amount of XRP burned per transaction (in token terms) decreases, but the value burned in fiat terms remains or increases. For example, Ultimately it will make more sense to transact a $10 XRP rather than a $1 XRP as less XRP will be burned during the settlement transaction.",2

The XRP then goes back into supply which puts the supply back to where it was before the transaction so the answer of supply and demand is moot at that point because neither bank is holding XRP once the transaction is done.",4

XRP,2024-11-30,post,XRP,XRP: A Comprehensive Analysis of its Potential ,"XRP: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Potential

As of November 30, 2024, XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) developed by Ripple Labs, trades at $1.88. XRP has consistently sparked debate for its unique design and use case as a financial instrument for institutions rather than a retail investment vehicle. This report explores XRP’s core functionality, how it differs from Bitcoin (BTC), its intended purpose, and why retail investors today have a lucrative opportunity before institutional adoption potentially restricts access.

How XRP Works

XRP operates as the native currency of the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain designed for fast, cost-effective, and scalable transactions. XRP acts as a bridge currency in cross-border payments, facilitating near-instant settlements with minimal fees.

Key Features of XRP and the XRP Ledger:

	1.	Speed: XRP transactions settle in 3–5 seconds, making it significantly faster than traditional banking systems and even most cryptocurrencies.
	2.	Cost: Transaction fees are extremely low (fractions of a cent), ideal for micropayments and large financial transfers alike.
	3.	Scalability: The network handles up to 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), far surpassing Bitcoin’s 7 TPS.
	4.	Energy Efficiency: Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, XRP Ledger uses a consensus protocol requiring minimal energy.

What XRP Does

XRP is primarily designed as a tool for cross-border payments and settlements, targeting inefficiencies in the global financial system. Ripple’s solutions aim to replace the outdated SWIFT system, which is slow, expensive, and prone to errors. XRP’s utility extends to:
	•	On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): XRP enables financial institutions to eliminate the need for pre-funded nostro/vostro accounts by serving as a bridge currency for instant liquidity.
	•	Remittances: XRP powers low-cost remittance corridors, allowing workers to send money home more efficiently.
	•	Asset Tokenization: The XRP Ledger supports tokenization, enabling financial institutions to represent real-world assets on the blockchain.

How XRP Differs from Bitcoin

XRP and Bitcoin serve fundamentally different purposes:

Aspect	Bitcoin (BTC)	XRP
Purpose	Digital gold and store of value	Bridge currency for financial institutions
Transaction Speed	~10 minutes	3–5 seconds
Fees	~$2–$10	~0.00001 XRP
Mechanism	Proof of Work (mining-intensive)	Consensus Protocol
Target Audience	Retail investors and institutions	Primarily financial institutions

Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency, while XRP is a tool for institutions to improve global payments. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP is not mined, meaning its supply is pre-determined and not subject to inflationary mining rewards.

Why XRP Wasn’t Designed for Retail Investors

Ripple designed XRP to solve specific institutional problems, not as a speculative asset for retail investors. Its utility lies in enabling:
	1.	Financial Institutions: Providing liquidity, reducing transaction times, and cutting costs for banks, payment providers, and other financial entities.
	2.	Regulated Use Cases: XRP aims to integrate into compliant financial systems globally, adhering to ISO 20022 and other financial standards.

This institutional focus means XRP’s primary utility lies in enabling cross-border financial flows, not in serving as a digital asset for individual investment. However, retail investors currently play a role by providing liquidity and driving early adoption.

Why Retail Investment in XRP Is Lucrative Now

Despite being institution-focused, XRP offers a unique opportunity for retail investors at its current stage of adoption. Here’s why:
	1.	Underutilization of Its Utility: XRP is still in the early stages of adoption. As more institutions integrate Ripple’s technology, demand for XRP will increase, potentially driving up its price.
	2.	Favorable Risk-Reward Ratio: With regulatory clarity on the horizon and Ripple’s expanding partnerships, XRP’s price could see exponential growth, presenting a strong case for investment at current levels.
	3.	Liquidity Incentives: As institutions ramp up adoption, the retail market provides necessary liquidity until institutional demand dominates.

Speculation: Why Retail Investors May Lose Access

Once XRP is globally adopted and used exclusively as a financial tool, retail investors may face barriers to investing:
	1.	Institutional Domination: If XRP becomes critical for cross-border payments, its liquidity and supply may be reserved for banks and financial institutions, limiting availability to retail investors.
	2.	Regulatory Restrictions: Governments and regulators may classify XRP as a utility token or security exclusively for institutional use, restricting retail trading.
	3.	Centralization of Control: Ripple or other governing bodies could implement mechanisms to prioritize institutional access to XRP, further limiting retail investment opportunities.

These factors could make XRP a scarce resource for individuals, enhancing its value and making current investment opportunities particularly attractive.

Conclusion: XRP’s Path to $20, $50, $100, and $1,000

The institutional focus of XRP does not negate its potential as a lucrative investment for retail investors today. Current market dynamics, regulatory progress, and adoption trends suggest that XRP is positioned for significant price appreciation. Each milestone—$20, $50, $100, and $1,000—aligns with Ripple’s expanding influence in the financial world:
	•	$20: Driven by growing institutional adoption and partnerships with over 200 financial entities.
	•	$50: Enabled by expanding remittance markets and ODL solutions.
	•	$100: Supported by regulatory clarity and integration into traditional financial systems.
	•	$1,000: Requires a transformative shift where XRP becomes a global settlement currency.

Investors today have a unique opportunity to invest in XRP while it is still accessible. The future of XRP may not include retail markets, making its current availability an unprecedented chance to participate in a global financial evolution.

XRP,2025-01-18,post,XRP,Most of you in this sub will not make it,"I left this sub the same week I joined it. Average post or comment here is mind numbing. Every time XRP crabs, this community strokes the fuck out. People were on suicide watch when we went from like $2.60 to $2.40 after being sub $1 like a month prior. Brother, if you can’t handle a 30% correction when we’re regularly trading at new local (and now all time) highs, you are not going to make it. Is this your first time trading literally anything?

Hopefully those of you that have been holding for at least more than a few months get it. I did not buy for a quick swing trade or even a 6x, 10x, or 100x. I’m here for the long run. If you’re still worried about market cap or the low burn rate from transactions limiting the price, you do not get it. I really don’t comprehend how some people are under the impression market cap increases and inflows are 1:1. Please get it the fuck together.

We’re looking at the most pro crypto administration we’ve ever seen, (non-BTC) crypto ETFs being seriously discussed by institutions, the lawsuit about to be officially OVER. These are major catalysts for sure, but none of these things were ever why anyone should have bought XRP. I bought because it is THE coin with the most utility. 

If you sell before the above catalysts happen, you’re a fucking moron.
If you sell before ripple starts tokenizing other assets on the XRP ledger or before XRP even starts getting adoption at any sort of meaningful scale, I don’t know why the fuck you bought XRP in the first place.

This is not financial advice.
Thank you and have a blessed day.

Hell it wasn’t like this before November. Been reading in this sub since almost a decade ago and honestly it’s quite obvious to what happened.

New money, young money got into this sub. it took years to get from 200k to 300k (which 300k hit a few months back) and since the November boom after trump won till now, we’ve almost doubled the entire sub in size. In about 80 days 😂.

So now instead of the occasional maybe once a week “wen lambo” people post (reacting like they hit the lottery on 5% gains and acting like the sun didn’t come out on a 5% loss) we get that about every 10 minutes now.

It can be a bad because it can be annoying as fuck to some. Especially people who’ve been in here for years, but it also sucks for actual newcomers trying to learn. Every other post now is nonsense that looks like it was posted by a 6 year old.

The good news is…. Well you know XRP is doing great, and is starting to play ball like many knew it could while patiently waiting for it to grow for weeks, months and/or years. So all the immature moon boy posts albeit irritating AF should leave a smile to some. Because the more of them in here means the more popular the coin has become. If we hit 5 million subs in the future that means we’ve gone up lots more in price. Higher prices brings more ppl. Can be a good thing 😉",12

I myself am a non-XRP crypto investor and I'm trying to figure out what percentage of you guys truly plan to hold until the outrageous levels you confidently type out. What stops me in my tracks is the valuation is always this flashy number like ""$8,000 XRP"" or ""We hold 'til XRP hits $20k baby!""

Explain the circumstances to me on why XRP being worth $350 or $600 doesn't sound tempting at all. You guys do understand that if you sell 75% of your stack at $350 you would still win, right? You could hold the rest and some of you would have $50,000+ just from selling at the lower price. 

Hell it may not have to increase that much! A $125 XRP changes the lives of a lot of people. There is no shame in cashing out a large section of your crypto at a 40x profit. Anybody who tells you that a 40x gain isn't good enough is a certified loon or possibly even crazier.",22

XRP,2025-01-24,comment,XRP,"Comment on: $950,000...","I don’t know if you’ll see this because there’s already 500+ comments but I will give you some important advice that you really need to listen to, research, then act on.

When your net worth reaches $1mil you become what is called an “accredited investor” which means you are able to invest in opportunities that normal people simply do not have access to. For example, I recently purchased stock in Ripple itself. Ripple is not a publicly traded company, normal people can not do that. 

What you need to do, right away, is find a high net worth CPA. They will help you manage your money, save you thousands in taxes, and most importantly find you ways to grow your money significantly without the risk that crypto presents. 

I will give you an example- My CPA found an opportunity where I can purchase a tractor trailer truck for ~$100000 and lease it to a trucking company for a percentage of its profit. My portion of the profit brings in roughly $3500/mo. After 5 years they will sell the truck and get back $60,000 of my investment. $3500 x 60mo = $210,000 then add the $60k from selling the truck and I have invested $100,000 and gotten back $270,000. That’s an opportunity that would not exist without my CPA. There are many others that are similar, ways to purchase property, and other advantageous actions they will teach you about and help you use. 

You have $1million, that gets you a seat at the big table, use it wisely and good luck!",11

XRP,2024-12-04,post,XRP,How RLUSD and XRP Are Used (EXPLANATION),"I noticed a lot of people asking questions about **RLUSD**, and **how it will affect** **XRP**, how does it work and so on, so I decided to compile the most important information in a very easy way to understand it.

# RLUSD (Stablecoin):

* It's a digital version of the US Dollar, pegged 1:1 to a real dollar.
* You use it like digital cash for transactions, but it stays tied to the Dollar's value.
* It's great for sending or receiving money **if the sender and receiver both want to deal in Dollars**.

# XRP (Bridge Currency):

* XRP is designed to **connect different currencies** (like RLUSD, Euros, Yen, etc.) and move value quickly and cheaply across borders.
* It's not pegged to any currency, it has its own market value.
* You use it when you need to send money between currencies or across systems (e.g., RLUSD in one place, Euros in another).

But wait, why should I use **XRP** if there will be **RLUSD**??

* If you're staying in **one currency (like RLUSD → RLUSD)**, XRP isn’t needed.
* But if you’re moving between **different currencies or systems**, XRP is the bridge that makes it all work seamlessly and cheaply.

Think of RLUSD as **digital cash** for Dollars, and **XRP** as the **global courier** that connects everyone. They work together in many cases, but they also serve different purposes depending on the transaction.

If it's still confusing, I will give an easy example.

In the real world, there are over **180 currencies** (like Dollars, Euros, Yen). Banks need to hold huge amounts of money in every currency to send money around the world. It's expensive and slow.

* XRP acts as a **bridge currency.**
* If someone in the U.S. wants to send $1 million to Japan, instead of needing both Dollars and Yen, they convert $1 million into **XRP**.
* The XRP is sent to Japan, and there, it’s turned into Yen.
* This is faster and cheaper because banks only need **XRP as the bridge**, not every currency in the world.
* RLUSD is like a **digital version of a dollar**.
* It’s backed 1:1, meaning every RLUSD is supported by a real dollar in a bank.
* This makes it safe and trustworthy.
* You can use RLUSD in the **digital world** (on the XRP Ledger or Ethereum) instead of cash.

Think of **XRP** as the **super-fast** delivery truck and **RLUSD** as the digital money it carries safely. Together, they make global money transfers easier, cheaper, and much faster. Instead of 6,000 different currency combinations (Dollars to Yen, Euros to Pesos, etc.), banks just need **XRP as a bridge. RLUSD** makes the dollar ready for this digital system too, so people can easily use it online.

Now, **what will happen once RLUSD** **launches**?

The launch of **RLUSD** could indirectly strengthen the **XRP** market, but the magnitude of the impact will depend on how quickly **RLUSD** gains adoption and integrates into real-world financial systems. 

**Expect some short-term excitement but** **focus on long-term utility for sustainable effects on XRP.**

HOPE THIS HELPS! <3 ",1749

XRP,2024-12-04,comment,XRP,Comment on: How RLUSD and XRP Are Used (EXPLANATION)...,"Nice.

There's another use case involving CBDCs issued on the XRPL mainnet (or even those issued on parallel private xrpl-based ledgers).

XRP and the XRPL is designed to rapidly swap and transfer digital currencies, not just fiat currencies.

Jap-xrpl (DYEN) --> trust line to mainnet XRPL (XYEN 1:1) --> XRP for transfer --> ... any supported fiat or other CBDC

The possibilities become endless - and super fast, cheap, efficient and seamlessly interoperable - in a new digital financial system.

XRP enables anything-to-anything transfers across borders. This is why Ripple talks about moving ""money"" like we currently send emails.",55

XRP,2024-12-04,comment,XRP,Comment on: How RLUSD and XRP Are Used (EXPLANATION)...,"It is also worth noting that the 1:1 backing comes either via actual dollars in a vault or other capital assets. Maybe, just maybe, Ripple utilises escrow XRP as a way to back the RLUSD. 

Example, if Ripple locked up their remaining tokens in escrow (around 30 Billion tokens) they would have around 180bil USD of backing to mint 180billion of RLUSD. 

If such a thing is part of the strategy i would highly doubt it would be done in one go, maybe a ratio mix of usd and xrp. Worth keeping an eye on..

If the value of XRP swung wildly down, I don't know how that would affect the 1:1, maybe they would adjust the amount of usd to cover.",7

XRP,2024-12-04,comment,XRP,Comment on: How RLUSD and XRP Are Used (EXPLANATION)...,"Thank you for the explanation.   
  
Even if I was a holder of XRP, when people say XRP will be used for every transaction and replace fiat, I never believed it. (The reason I bought XRP was my anticipation xrp can shoot like a rocket after the SEC lawsuit).

But now we have RLUSD, it looks really promising. XRP will become a bridging method and on the outside, RLUSD will be used like USD on crypto industry. 

I don't think Ripple made this plan from the beginning, but they did a really good job. Starting this stable coin business made this whole narrative work.",5
XRP,2024-12-04,comment,XRP,Comment on: How RLUSD and XRP Are Used (EXPLANATION)...,This is awesome thank you for explaining it to me like this. So ripple made its own digital money and making it evenly to the US dollar that people and banks will have to use XRP to send their digital currency to other people and banks. This is going to be huge in 5 to 15 years. IMO  …,4

I'm relatively new to the game and I know alot of fake talk is being said in crypto same as in stocks market to promote some stocks over the others, but I sense these talks about XRP are different and pointing out that it has great potential of becoming a major financial tool in the near future.

XRP,2025-01-08,comment,XRP,Comment on: XRP News About Implementation...,It’s all GAMBLING.,8
XRP,2025-01-09,comment,XRP,Comment on: XRP News About Implementation...,The way I see it is… why couldn’t xrp make it to 100-1000? I mean what exactly does ethereum do? There is no real worldwide use case for ethereum. Maybe some nerdy tech guys use it but otherwise where is its real world application? And it is currently what 2500$? Aave is like 400? So just by comparison I don’t see why xrp couldn’t get to similar numbers with just better exposure to the world. I also wonder if the fact that the US has basically suppressed xrp means that it stands to have the most growth of any current crypto. Maybe it only goes to 10-20 but that would still be a great return. But if it is really able to do what they intend… I think it’s very possible it could make it to 1k.,5
XRP,2025-01-08,comment,XRP,Comment on: XRP News About Implementation...,"In VERY wishful thinking, if XRP utility could capture between 2% to 5% of the global market wealth and transactions (money, real estate, precious metals, commodities like Oil, etc).  With a global wealth (rounded to a whole number) $450 trillion, then you could see a market capitalization between $9T and $22.5T (YES, those are high numbers).  If there are 99 billion tokens in circulation by time it reaches $9T, it would be about $91 per coin.  On the high side reaching the market cap at $22.5T would make the coin around $227. 

Under a more realistic approach, XRP has more capability and utility than just cross-border banking, but given stiff competition from other alt coins or resistance to change from governments, corporate agencies, etc., it's market cap may only have a potential to $2T.  Which, at 99 billion coins in circulation, the price would be just over $20 per coin.  
  
In all, dismiss the hype of $500, $1,000, or $10,000 per coin.  It's unrealistic, even in 10 to 15 years after all coins reach circulation from escrow. I would be happy if the coin reached $10 by 2030.   
  
And of course, everything is speculative. So only play with what you're willing to lose.",7

XRP,2025-07-01,post,XRP,RKLB vs XRP - learn how trends and increased prices of assets/stocks/etc work.,"Instead of writing a long drawn out post about why or how XRP will go up, most of you who are getting crazy about the price seem to think it will be 2 dollars one day and 1000 the next. Even if that does happen, the only way it happens is to buy, hold, and no one takes profit along the way. Not gonna happen. Institutional investors, day traders, etc. take profit and move on, reinvest, and continue. Every time the price goes up, liquidity will drop causing a price decrease.

Look at RKLB stock price as a good example of what can happen and how it happens going from single to double digits, and how long that process takes. I think it will give you all who are constantly mooning a good perspective on how patience and consistent investment causes price to go up.

This is truly bullshit because,  the burn rate is .00001 xrp for every transaction and SWIFT currently does about 40 million transaction a day (2023)..  So basically  .00001 x 40m which leaves us at 400 xrp being Burned daily.  400xrp burned daily is about 140k yearly.  this is truly ALARMING. You could clearly see that 140k wont Cut the SUPPLY enough until the year 9024 (7000 yrs ).

XRP,2024-12-07,comment,XRP,"Comment on: XRP to $10,000.... really? Lol...","Hop onto xrpscan and take a look at the burns happening. Much more than 140k yearly. This is without adoption. There’s many posts and videos on this subject, some are old, some are new, but has been talked about for over half a decade

The $10k theory isn’t about burns. Whoever is saying it can reach that through burns doesn’t understand how xrp works. This will help clarify how it works:

Let’s say $100 billion needs to be moved by banks through the use of xrp. There are 100 billion tokens. That means at $1 they would need to use all 100 billion tokens in existence. Let’s say we factor in available tokens of the circulating supply (not held by retail, banks, institutions, etfs, etps, and ripple etc) now we get a much smaller number. Let’s say 50 billion circ supply goes down to 30 billion. Now that $1  xrp is now $3. Now let’s say banks are moving on the ledger what swift moves in a day which is $5 trillion. This is the milestone many in the community look towards. That $3 token is now $133

JP Morgan facilitates $10 trillion worth of payments per day. Their MC is not $10 trillion. If a token were used to facilitate these payments, and there were 50 billion of these tokens available how much would that token need to be worth to move that amount of money? $200. What about 40B tokens, 30B, 25B, you get the idea. Banks won’t sell any tokens being used for payments, just to buy them back again for payments. So those tokens are just being circulated within the ecosystem, forever shrinking due to burning. The top 5 banks in the US move approx $40T a day. That’s just the US. $50T @ 25B available tokens is $2k a token

Now take tokenization of rwa’s, where real estate is $300 trillion, and the derivatives market is over $1 quadrillion. This is where it gets serious. This is what BlackRock wants, and we all know BR. They want to tokenize and own everything. They weren’t interested in crypto until they understood tokenization. Now they’re all in

BlackRock is partnered with Securitize. Securitize recieved funding from Ripple and coinbase for $13m. Carlos Domingo (ceo and co-founder of securitize) spoke at ripples yearly conference. Paul Atkins (next in-line for SEC chair) is on the advisory board of securitize. BlackRock will get what they want, so will securitize, and I believe Ripple will as well

At the end of the day, no one knows what will happen. I highly doubt ripple will get ALL of the money in the world moving through them.

XRP,2025-02-18,post,XRP,We are 6-10 days away from a major top in XRP. Get ready!,"1st picture:
PI cycle top indicator on daily for XRP

Notice how when the 2 moving averages crossed we have a top marked by the 1st blue line. 

Then consolidation as the green line diverges to the upside above the red line, the April 2017 top comes in marked by the second blue line. That move took 6 days as u can see.

2nd picture:
 is where we are now. The MA cross is marked by the blue line. Notice how the cross happens during the dip just like 2017.

The moving averages are now diverging just like 2017 with red on top and green on bottom. If it plays out like 2017 we should see the next top in 6 days. Since this cycle is less volatile than 2017, moving slower with less overall volume we can increase that to around 10-15 days give or take

I fully believe from now to Feb 28 we are going to see a major top in XRP, what major event is happening around that date involving crypto? I'll let u research that, but there is one involving XRP and ONDO. I can't give u all the goodies, u gotta do some work yourself 🤣🤣

I just came across an article saying that Brad confirmed a meeting with Trump. Does anyone know if this could be the reason for the recent bump in XRP's price?

XRP,2024-08-12,post,XRP,Weekly XRP Daily Chart Analysis ,"[XRP Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/83164ems4bid1.png?width=4054&format=png&auto=webp&s=52edcddf4871c332dddfd2d754f331136509c345)

FOR MY FELLOW APES AND THOSE WHO DON'T LOOK AT CHARTS

What people need to understand is what drives price in stocks and crypto is Supply & Demand. When people buy XRP, it goes up. When people sell XRP, it goes down. It's that simple. And a big deciding factor of when people buy and sell are lines. (No not those kinda lines) But trend lines and support/resistance lines.

**Whats Going On:** We are still within the Symmetrical Triangle (Red Lines) dating back from 2020-2021. We are gradually in an uptrend from 2020 Lows (.10 cents) and a downtrend from 2021 Highs ($1.7-$1.9). As you can see from the chart, we are getting really close to the end of the triangle where breakouts usually happen, either upside or downside.

We are currently in a uptrend (Green Line) within the symmetrical triangle but are meeting hard resistance (Blue Lines) at the 0.60-0.64 zones. People like to take profits at these prices thus driving the price down. Even with the announcement of the settlement, investors took profits at this hard resistance line. To continue this uptrend, we will need to break this resistance zone.

**What Now:** I myself am accumulating as much XRP as I can as long as we are within the red lines. I myself would like to test the bottom red line one more time to get a big bag, but wouldn't mind an uptrend either. If we can't breakout of this symmetrical triangle anytime soon, then we will continue this pattern til probably early 2025. NFA!

NFA: I'm just an ape from WallStreetBets that likes the coin.",111

XRP,2024-10-14,post,XRP,Interesting discussion on what gives or will give XRP value,"Hello all,

I came across this discussion on X, which I found very interesting. Or at least, I found the logic of what this person was saying interesting but I have no idea whether what he says is realistic or not. Judge for yourself and please share your views.

[Here is the X thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1845263055245996273.html?s=09).",57
XRP,2024-10-14,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,"Bullet points because I'm short on time.

- Ripple releases 1B XRP each month (or, more precisely, the escrow contract does - Something Ripple can't change). Most of it gets returned to escrow every month because there is no demand for it (at the moment). There is a chain of escrow contracts that have fixed parameters and this will continue for the foreseeable future (medium term at least). The returned XRP is put at the back of the queue of escrow contracts and will stay there until it cycles to the front again. All of this is publicly viewable on the XRPL. There are no mysteries or secrets here. 

Check my math on https://xrpscan.com/metrics but quickly in my head there is a couple of billion XRP actively circulating daily (as opposed to 56B ***available** to circulate).

IMHO, while the idea that the price of XRP will have to go up significantly to be useful to financial institutions is probably sound there will have to be orders of magnitude increase in demand to soak up the available supply and create the demand necessary to start driving the price. 

Will we get there? Eventually. I'm not holding my breath.",10
XRP,2024-10-14,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,"I remember reading something about a year ago where Brad Garlinghouse said basically the same thing and that XRP has to be a high price for banks to transfer large amounts, otherwise every transaction would make the price fluctuate too wildly (ie: transferring 100 thousand XRP instead of 100 million).",8
XRP,2024-10-14,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,The thing that gives XRP it's value is the same thing that gives everything it's value. Supply and demand. It's valuable because people want it. Why do people want it? Because it's fast and easy to use and the transaction fees are tiny fractions of 1 cent.,3
XRP,2024-10-16,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,There is one thing missing. XRP‘s transaction time is 3-5 seconds. So if the Price is not high enough to send the whole volume in one transaction it can do it with just more transactions.,2
XRP,2024-10-17,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,"Ripple will be used by the east as defiance to the dollar. They will use some form of gold reserves where 1 xrp coin will = the price of gold. It will start at a ounce but then people will realize to much xrp is being exchanged and there isn't enough supply of xrp for the east transactions then it'll go to kilo of gold very quickly. This will be the east defiance to the dollar.

Once it reaches the ounce of gold, retail will be cut off from buying xrp because the supply will be meant for the big institutions. The united states won't like this because it means the dollar has collapsed. Some catastrophe will cause the dollar to loose it's worth maybe something like hyper inflation due to mass printing by the government to provide for their programs.

The east will get mad at the united states because as the us prints money the east will need more dollars to buy and deal with the us which will equal defiance and b.r.i.c.s will deploy xrp cross border.  Again it'll be immediately pegged to gold with each countries gold reserves as proof. So basically the east will go back to the gold standard.",2

Vechain Ada are 💩

There are ONLY 3 Companies in the crypto industry who have the prestigious IPO.

COINBASE 
RIPPLE
USDC CIRCLE

Rest all is air 🌬

Coinbase is the ONLY Crypto Custodian to ALL the Bitcoin ETF'S ,  whether it be Blackrock ETF, Fidelity or others.

That's because SEC CANNOT GIVE A NON-IPO UNREGULATED COMPANY access to Pension funds of American Citizens. Hense COINBASE.

Same for Ripple. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said he only has 1 goal in mind that's tokenization of Global assets including stocks bonds real estate inorder to eliminate the severe inefficiencies of current slow local system.

A guy in U.S cannot buy foreign stocks bonds real estate on a whim. Let alone 5 day swift transfer. 

All this BANK'S business will go to Ripple as they will have the IPO. 

Bank's can't give to others. Do other companies have regulatory clarity. Do they have IPO.

You need shit ton of Regulations papers 📃 if u wanna get Government's business.

Public Companies are heavily heavily regulated. The amount of details they have to declare is near madness but mandatory as people's savings are invested there.

Hence making them legit.

Xrp will be $100 by 2027

There's recession WAR tokenization swift hype fomo, Ripple Loans, Blackrock etc etc

Just XRP ETF alone can take xrp triple digits.

YOU ONLY GET TO BE RIGHT ONCE ✅️.

There are rumors of entire financial system shifting yo global blockchain by 2030

XRP,2024-10-17,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,"Well, I am not sure I agree with you for the following reasons:

1. Ripple is a US company and if ""strategic independence"" is what you are providing as a reason, then that will not happen by relying on what is still an American company.

1. Will ""the East"" as you refer to it try to transition itself away from the USD? Very likely, yes in the same way as they are collectively and individually trying to challenge the so-called ""international rules-based order"". Will they succeed? Difficult to say...at least for me. But even if they succeed this type of a situation will manifest itself decades away from now and not in what we commonly think in terms of short and medium term.

Speaking for myself only, these are not reasons to invest in anything. The timeline is too distant, the premise (which is geopolitics) is inherently unstable and unpredictable since there are n-number of variables at play.

I do think XRP will rise in value but that will be due to its current utility-value and once the negative sentiment brought upon it by this SEC case is settled. What might happen 50-75 years down the road is not what I am thinking about.

My reasoning, unlike yours, is rather simplistic. XRP's ATH was $3.40 (or thereabouts). This means XRP has actually reached this value. There is no speculation about this. It also means that it can theoretically reach that value again. So, that accounts for my base line.

I see a key resistance at $1.19 (or thereabouts). Why? Again, this is a level it has reached after crashing from it's ATH. Once these two conditions are met, I think XRP has a very good chance of reaching a level between $5 and $10 with the former level acting as the ""new $ 1.19 resistance line"" and $10 being the ATH.

This, I speculate, will happen because (1) XRP will be free of the SEC issue (2) the relationships and agreements that Ripple has been developing with financing institutions will come to fruition, and (3) more XRP ETFs. And, I expect all this to happen optimistically by 2026 and realistically by 2030.",1
XRP,2024-10-14,comment,XRP,Comment on: Interesting discussion on what gives or will give ...,I don't  see how an ETF alone will bring xrp to triple digits unless you mean 1.00 USD.  The ETH etf barely moved the eth needle.  Btc etf did cause a bump but not a 150-200x gain.,5

XRP,2025-01-21,post,XRP,Detach Trump from XRP and Ripple - Focus on the Tech,"As passionate believers in XRP and Ripple, it's time we detach the idea of Trump from our belief in this technology. Yes, Trump has hinted at making regulations friendlier, which could benefit the crypto space, but let's not forget that the success of XRP and Ripple doesn't solely hinge on him.

Ripple, led by Brad Garlinghouse and his team, fought and won a significant battle against the SEC without any help from Trump. The technology—XRP, XRPL, and the dedicated development teams—has proven resilient and capable of thriving even amidst regulatory challenges.

Consider Ripple's strategic expansion into markets like Dubai, Japan, and Singapore. This isn't just about U.S. regulations; it's about a global vision. Ripple's marketing and development teams have worked tirelessly to build a robust and scalable ecosystem that stands on its own.

Let's keep our focus on the tech, the community, and the progress. Trump or no Trump, Ripple and XRP have shown they can adapt, survive, and grow. Believe in the technology and the teams behind it. Stay calm, DCA, HODL, and possibly take profit wherever we can.

If so you are buying low. Do you think it won’t go higher? Sell and invest in a different project. Use your discretion. Best of luck",12

XRP,2024-12-07,post,XRP,The split in conviction behind potential XRP price range is crazy ,"This is supposed to be a genuine discussion around the huge range in price expectations I’ve seen across this sub and not calling out one end of the spectrum or the other for being ‘deluded’. It seems like there is a real split in understanding of what XRP’s function and potential is which I find really interesting. 

I’ve seen strong explanations for max $1-10 which is countered with “XRP wouldn’t function properly at this price point” and I’ve seen just as strong for $100-1,000-10,000 which is countered with the “insane Market Cap argument”. 

Considering this is such an extreme difference between the two price expectations, my questions is, why is there such a large spread? Is it just down to hopium? Or lack of understanding? Or because it completely depends on level of adoption?

This is not supposed to be a ‘when moon’ post so I’m hoping we can have a good discussion. Although this may be wishful thinking…",20
XRP,2024-12-07,comment,XRP,Comment on: The split in conviction behind potential XRP price...,"I am by no means an expert on crypto, but I've been reading up on where the true value of XRP is going to rest. For BTC, it was the first so it's value was purely novelty and people buying in. But what I have realized is that there is a short mindset vs. a long mindset with regard to crypto investors. The shorters can't imagine what the true long game is. I don't think most people here will. I believe the core value here is reflected by it's compliance with regulation and its utility going forward. Because it's compliant, the global economic powers that be would jump at adopting XRP because at the end of the day greed will always win and the banks always want a way to save money and make money. What is unprecedented is the retail buyers access to this type of investment this early. I personally wouldn't doubt a 20-30$/XRP valuation, but I also wouldn't doubt a 20k-30k/XRP either because I'm intellectually honest and this number comports with reason. Anyone that would deny either path forward has allowed their arrogance to cloud their natural curiosity for what is possible.",8
XRP,2024-12-07,comment,XRP,Comment on: The split in conviction behind potential XRP price...,"IMO, its the people that hold very small amounts of tokens that need massive amounts of x's that have the copium of it being very very high. People with larger amounts invested, early, are more realistic.

If XRP goes to $10,

Someone with 1000 coins only makes $10,000 minus inital cost.

Someone with 20000 coins makes $200,000 minus inital cost.

Its just pure copium. All this is a big ""IF"". XRP is not trying to diversify and only hoping on one big thing, SWIFT usage. If swift fails, it can go to 0. Other coins are trying to have many other use cases to diversify.

If XRP is used in some setting, I suspect $5-7.50 this run and a heavy downtrend in crypto winter(bear market) not including dillution from unlreased coins.",21

XRP,2024-11-15,post,XRP,FOX news interview with Brad Garlinghouse (Ripple CEO),"**Liz:** The blockchain payments company Ripple, which uses XRP to enable transactions, jumped dramatically since election night. And it saw big surges earlier this week on speculation that its CEO held a meeting with the president-elect following his victory and speculation that anti-crypto SEC chief Gary Gensler might soon announce his resignation, which we just talked about with former SEC director Norm Champ, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is here in a Fox Business exclusive in studio to discuss all of this. OK, a 70 percent gain since Election Day. Let me guess, you are a Donald Trump fan, at least of a presidency as he oversees a crypto world that he's very open armed to.

**Brad:** For sure. Like what a difference 10 days makes. We for years in the United States have had an attack on the crypto industry. It's been war. And we finally, I think, have a crypto president. The crypto industry has embraced Trump. Trump has embraced the crypto industry.

**Liz:** He really has. He really has.

**Brad:** I think it's very genuine. And I think he sees the opportunity. He sees innovation. He sees entrepreneurship. And look, I'm very excited about what the future holds.

I'll point out, you were saying that XRP is up 70 plus percent. Since Election Day, the best performing crypto assets are all U.S. companies or U.S. technologies. This shouldn't be a surprise. The United States SEC has been manipulating and putting pressure on these U.S. companies, U.S. technologies. And now that pressure comes off and they explode upwards. So we shouldn't be surprised by that.

**Liz:** So that is since when that it's all U.S.

**Brad:** Really since Election Day.

**Liz:** OK, since Election Day, then that that really makes sense.

**Brad:** It does. And if you can even put a number on this, like what has Gary Gensler's war on crypto, you can put an amount on it. We went from two point two trillion. to basically three trillion so this was an 800 billion dollar unlock just because we now are going to have rational actors who act lawfully you know as as you know well the states have now even participated in suing the sec and saying you are not acting lawfully and enforcing the laws

**Liz: I** gotta ask you, the price of xrp earlier this week spasmed. It jumped about 10 after you liked a tweet earlier that suggested you may have met with President-elect Donald Trump. Any truth to those rumors?

**Brad:** I mean, I think like many of your guests today, I'm not going to comment on too many specifics here. Suffice it to say.

**Liz:** OK, that's a yes. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But I respect that. But to me, it's a yes.

**Brad:** We have been active throughout this election cycle in being very pro-crypto, pro-innovation. And how do we make sure that this Congress and the president, obviously, is it's a totally new day. And I could not be happier about like a Congress that I think is As Norm said earlier, your guest, we got to get away from regulation through enforcement. That makes no sense.

**Liz:** What about this? Yesterday, this lawsuit filed by 18 attorneys generals, I believe all from Republican states suing the SEC, saying that they are allegedly over-reaching when it comes to crypto regulation. Did you know that that was coming at all?

**Brad:** We did not. And I say to all 18 of those attorney generals, welcome to the party. Look, Ripple's been fighting this fight since the very beginning. We've spent literally over $150 million fighting the SEC, an unlawful war. And so I'm thrilled they're joined. I wish they would have joined earlier. But even in their case, what they filed cites the Ripple case over and over. And so they see what has happened. They see how Gensler has overreached. And I only wish there was a way to hold the SEC, hold Gensler, hold some of these people accountable.

**Liz:** And we should say that earlier this week, Robinhood relisted XRP on its platform, driven by what they believe might be this new, more welcoming regulatory environment.

**Brad:** For sure. This goes back to like the U.S. has finally unlocking this hostility. And I do think things like Robinhood is saying, you know, I'm surprised they didn't do it sooner, but I'm glad they did it now. And, you know, I expect

**Liz:** Robinhood, by the way, up 37 percent this month alone. nice move for robin hood and he flat as 10 of the CEOs sat here and said that crypto has been a huge driver for their bottom line.

**Brad:** I mean, he said that it actually is an order magnitude a 10x decrease in cost for it in order for him to trade.

**Liz:** Brad, thanks for stopping by. It's great to see you, Brad Garlinghouse. All right, folks.",95

Next year is looking like a massive year for crypto in general. We’ve gone from almost every country being firmly against crypto to now every country racing to be the most pro-crypto nation, embracing and adopting it everywhere.

Once the Trump administration takes office it’ll be interesting to see what happens. If they come running out the gate and throw the SEC case in the bin like they said they would, follow through with their no-tax statements for US based cryptocurrencies etc etc then XRP could literally explode. This is potentially the beginning of the dot-com boom for crypto, but this will be much bigger. In a mania/FOMO driven environment like that, everyone’s arguments of “that market cap isn’t possible blah blah” are irrelevant because rational valuations tend to go out the window.

There are still people arguing about ridiculous P/E ratios for stocks that are unrealistic, meanwhile said stock continues to climb. Prices can be disjointed from the fundamentals. I believe $1,000 is definitely possible, not sure about in 2025 though.

In a world where BTC is over $13M, if XRP becomes everything it’s lining up to be, then its price could easily be in the thousands. Just my opinion.",4

XRP,2025-02-24,post,XRP,Question about XRP token- Store of value or just simple intermediary,"Hey everyone,

I've been diving into XRP and trying to wrap my head around its long-term potential. From what I understand, its main value proposition is to act as a bridge currency for international transactions—allowing someone to convert euros into XRP, then XRP into dollars, all at lower costs and much higher speeds than traditional systems like SWIFT or even Visa.

But here's where I get stuck: if XRP is just an intermediary in these transactions, why would its value increase over time? If it's simply facilitating transfers rather than being a store of value itself, what’s the incentive to hold it long-term?

Would love to hear from XRP enthusiasts or skeptics—what's your take on XRP as an investment versus a purely transactional tool?

XRP,2025-02-24,comment,XRP,Comment on: Question about XRP token- Store of value or just s...,"I’m not an expert here but from what I’ve heard is the price of XRP is determined by supply and demand. So in the near future if XRP starts to become adopted by big corps and governments then each XRP will become way more valuable and they will most likely start to regulate how much XRP you can buy starting a supply shock.

So there could be a short timeframe in the future where one XRP could be worth thousands of dollars.",6
XRP,2025-02-24,comment,XRP,Comment on: Question about XRP token- Store of value or just s...,Something I've heard is it needs to be high value in order to facilitate huge payments between institutions.

Unless XRP goes to zero which is unlikely to happen then they will be successful. Oh yeah did I also mention that they are utilizing bots to stabilize the price? Idk man I have a small interest in XRP but the more I learn about it the less I want to keep building it up.

XRP,2025-02-24,comment,XRP,Comment on: Question about XRP token- Store of value or just s...,A lot of what is driving the current market price is speculation. The tokens have no intrinsic value but if banks adopt it for cross border payments then in theory it could become more valuable.,2
XRP,2025-02-24,comment,XRP,Comment on: Question about XRP token- Store of value or just s...,"XRP is often referred to as the “banker’s token” for a reason…it’s due to its adoption by major financial institutions and its use in on-demand liquidity (ODL) for cross border payments. 

 As mentioned…It acts as a bridge currency for fast, low cost transactions, allowing banks and payment providers to move funds efficiently. As demand for faster, cheaper global payments grows, XRP’s utility increases, which can drive its value over time. With a limited supply and real-world use, XRP has enormous long term potential in the global financial ecosystem.

 major institutions like Bank of America, SBI Holdings, and other global banks have already acknowledged their plans to use XRP once the SEC case is resolved. This widespread support highlights XRP’s critical role in the future of cross border payments and its growing adoption by traditional financial networks.

And lastly…Nostro Vostro accounts hold trillions globally, locking up capital for cross border transactions. XRP can reduce or eliminate this need, freeing up liquidity and cutting costs for banks by offering real time, on-demand settlement. This efficiency boost can significantly transform how banks handle international payments.",2

XRP,2024-12-12,post,XRP,"David Schwartz (Ripple CTO). RLUSD ""coins are perfectly liquid to XRP at face value on the ledger"", ""they spend like XRP""","Transcript of David Schwartz's recent video explaining RLUSD. Source in comments.

>Hi, this is David Schwartz, also known as JoelKatz, CTO at Ripple. I recently released a list of suggestions for XRP Ledger development, and I got a lot of questions about the stablecoin proposal. So I thought it might be helpful for me to walk through what I have in the design to give people a better idea of how I intended the system to work.

>Um, so first of all, it’s a collateralized stablecoin. That means tokenized assets whose value is are expected to remain constant in some unit. So if it’s a dollar stablecoin and you have 10 of it, you’re expecting its value to remain stable at $10. These assets have a backing asset, in this case, XRP. That means that there is something that is supposed to guarantee its value. Now, in some of those systems, you can actually redeem the stablecoin for the backing asset. In some, you can’t.

>What’s interesting about this proposal is that the stablecoins are perfectly liquid to XRP at face value on the ledger. So in other words, if you have a dollar and a dollar stablecoin designed on the system, what you have is a $1 claim on XRP, enforceable by The Ledger payment mechanics. And the reason that that’s important is with some other stablecoin designs, if the stablecoin isn’t popular, it won’t necessarily be liquid. If it’s not listed on an exchange, if it can’t easily be deposited and withdrawn, it won’t be that useful. By the design of this system, the stablecoins can be offered through the on-Ledger decentralized exchange, and they spend like XRP. So you don’t need to find some way to make them liquid. You can just spend them right on The Ledger. And of course, they can be pegged to anything that someone can provide a price feed on.

>Fiat currencies are probably what people typically think of, like dollars and Euros or whatever, but they can also be pegged to things like stocks or precious metals or any other value source as long as someone can provide a price feed for it. You can have a stablecoin pegged to that value.

>So there are five critical components to the system. There’s the operator, that’s the person or entity that provides the price feed and creates the system. There’s the price feed itself. There are the collateralized positions. These are the things that hold the collateral. Then there’s the Redemption process, which is the way that someone who holds the stablecoin converts it into XRP. And then there’s a series of incentives to ensure that the stablecoin remains convertible to sufficient XRP to back its value.",94

It's a type of algorithmic stablecoin that can peg it's value with unstable assets like XRP or other digital assets. We know how that went down with UST and Luna. This proposal from David was from 2019, mind you. We didn't have first world experience of a big stablecoin collapse, then.

XRP,2024-12-12,comment,XRP,"Comment on: David Schwartz (Ripple CTO). RLUSD ""coins are perf...","Ripple's plan is to make xrp an international currency exchange token. Every transaction performed would cost 0.00001 xrp, which would then burn itself. Deflation occurs at a rate so slow that is negligeable.
Ripple holds in escrow the majority of xrp, and do releases according to supply needs.
Now, as Ripple's business is that banks use xrp as a bridge, their interest is in charging the transaction fee. But since transaction fee is a flat 0.00001 xrp, that means that Ripple, in order to make transactions afordable, must aim at keeping xrp price low. And since they control supply through escrow releases... I don't see why or how could xrp price skyrocket.

This is a discussion about a ""general"" stablecoin  proposal.

RLUSD will be redeemable for XRP at face-value (and vice-versa) because they both exist on the XRPL. 

But, RLUSD will be backed by fiat deposits... that's what makes it a regulated and compliant stable coin. It will undertake regular audits to remain compliant. Every RLUSD that is minted will have an equivalent USD$1 available. Unlike USDT which is backed by ... ???... maybe some fiat, some Bitcoin, some debt instruments and some magic fairy dust, because it has never been independently audited for compliance.

My understanding is that RLUSD will not be _backed_ by XRP. He's talking about other scenarios, wherein you might tokenise an asset and back it with XRP based on an independent price feed.",8

XRP,2025-01-05,post,XRP,Message from Brad Garlinghouse,"2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real. For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler's SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved.

Today:
✅75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based, while over the last 4 years, the vast majority of hires were outside the US
✅We signed more US deals in the last six weeks of 2024 (since the election) than the previous six MONTHS

Team Trump is already jumpstarting innovation and job growth in the US with Scott Bessent, David Sacks, Paul Atkins and others at the helm, and they aren’t even in office yet! Say what you want, but the “Trump effect” is already making crypto great again – through his campaign, and in the Administration’s day 1 priorities.",1105

So, if XRP wasn't held back by the SEC then we should be trading between 5 and 6 dollars per coin. This should be our starting point going forward with the new era of finance.

XRP,2025-01-02,post,XRP,Would anyone be interested in an XRP-focused news app?,"With the recent bull run the majority of coins are experiencing I've been suffering through my fair share of FOMO and FUD. So I decided to put together a quick iOS app to help curb my enthusiasm and give me more holistic news than just a subreddit post. Then I realised that summarising it with AI was the perfect way to take tons of news and information and keep it succinct. Helping me to form prosperous decisions instead of jumping in an ATH's! My buddies and I enjoyed using it so much, I figured I'd share it for free! In the hopes of helping others out in the same way! You can find the App Store link below:

[https://polyphasicdevs.com/xrpdashboard](https://polyphasicdevs.com/xrpdashboard)

EDIT: So, i got really waylaid with coding on Android and had to make the decision to build this in React as it's so much easier. Which means soon i will be pushing an update to the iOS version that will erase everyone's portfolio, please be advised of this change. The new app is a bit simpler, but will remain FREE to use! IAP will be incoming since i've seen quite a few users come in from this post alone, thank you very much for using the app and I'm so happy if any one person can benefit from this!

Because I changed tech stacks to a web-based stack, it made sense to have this available on web for anyone with any device that has a fairly recent browser: [https://xrpdashboard.us](https://xrpdashboard.us)

When [XRP is Four,](https://coinmarketcap.com/) buy some more.

When XRP is Three, leave it be. 

My Trog-friendly simple plan is based on the observation that when the market cap drops, XRP drops to slot #4, this means everyone is selling off or taking profits.  When XRP's market cap rises, it is too ""hot,"" and rises to #3, because there's a FOMO run or a FOMO-adjacent dynamic in play.

Yes, emotional trading is a bad idea.   
question yourself: Can I miss this money? what if i go to the casino and loose it all, can i get by? 

If your answer is yes: go ahead and buy for another 5k, if your answer is no or maybe, simply don't do it. 

  
I do think that XRP can still kick off, when its going to move upwards again, and FOMO is taking over from new investors. we just have no idea where it could end.

I'm always debating when I should buy. Nobody knows anything - I don't sweat ""losing"" the money but I also want to get the highest ROI (e.g. the lowest price per coin). I know that you cannot time the market and that time in the market beats timing it (with traditional investments anyways).

XRP,2025-03-21,post,XRP,XRP fails to skyrocket after SEC drops its appeal.,"The XRP market has remained relatively calm despite the final resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.


The SEC’s recent decision to withdraw its appeal officially brought the high-profile case to a close, ending years of uncertainty for the company and the XRP token.

After the development, XRP saw a short-lived spike to $2.60 before returning to around $2.43. The reaction has surprised many in the crypto community who expected the legal victory to trigger a sustained price rally.


On The Good Morning Crypto show, host Abdullah “Abs” Nassif addressed the disappointment among XRP holders. He said many retail investors had followed the case closely, anticipating a sharp increase in value once Ripple was cleared.

According to Johnny Krypto, co-founder of Merlin, the muted price response was predictable. He explained that the market had already reacted in advance, pointing to the surge from $0.50 to $2.50 in November because Ripple expected to win the lawsuit.

Krypto stated that markets tend to price in major events before they occur, especially when the outcome becomes widely anticipated. He added that if the SEC had pursued the appeal, XRP could have dropped significantly instead of maintaining stability.


The resolution of the case has removed a significant obstacle for Ripple. However, analysts agree that it will take more than legal clarity to push XRP to new highs in the current market environment.",543

XRP,2025-01-10,post,XRP,Why XRP Could Hit $100 (and Why Market Cap Doesn't Matter for Utility Coins) ,"TL;DR: XRP could hit $100 because its utility drives demand, and market cap is irrelevant for utility coins. As adoption grows and XRP becomes integral to global finance, its price will reflect its role, not its supply. Market cap is just a number—it doesn’t define the true value of a utility token like XRP

----

I see a lot of people dismissing the idea of XRP reaching $100 because of ""market cap,"" but here's the thing: market cap isn't the ultimate metric for utility coins. Let me explain why XRP's value could rise significantly despite its large supply.

**Utility > Market Cap**

XRP is a utility token, meaning its value is tied to its use case, not speculation. XRP is designed to facilitate cross-border payments, liquidity, and settlement for financial institutions. If institutions globally adopt XRP for transferring trillions of dollars daily, its price will rise naturally, because the demand for XRP will outpace its supply.

Market cap is simply a math equation: price × supply. It’s not a hard ceiling that limits a coin’s price. For utility coins like XRP, what really matters is how much demand their utility generates. If XRP is essential for moving global money efficiently, its price could easily rise regardless of market cap.

 **Global Money Movement is Massive**

The global cross-border payment market processes trillions of dollars annually. XRP is positioned as a bridge currency to reduce friction and costs in these transactions. The potential market for XRP’s utility is enormous.

If XRP becomes a key player in settling even a fraction of global payments, the volume and demand for XRP will skyrocket. At that point, the concept of market cap becomes irrelevant because XRP’s price reflects its role in the global financial system.

**High Price is Necessary for XRP’s Functionality**

For XRP to be effective in large-scale payments, its price needs to increase. Why? Because higher prices mean less XRP is needed to settle large transactions. Imagine moving $10 trillion in cross-border payments—at $1 per XRP, you’d need 10 trillion XRP. At $100 per XRP, you’d only need 100 billion.

This efficiency is critical for financial institutions using XRP as a bridge asset. The higher the price, the more efficient the system becomes.

**Market Cap is a Misleading Metric for Utility Coins**

Market cap makes sense for stocks or speculative assets, but it’s not a meaningful metric for utility tokens. Utility coins derive their value from their adoption and usage within their ecosystem. If XRP is solving real-world problems, its price can rise regardless of market cap, because the demand is based on function, not speculation.

Everyone just keeps saying we're going to get rich and If XRP goes up to any significant amount, the only way to get rich is to sell it. If everyone sells XRP to become rich, wouldn't that crash the price? Why would institutions adopt it if the price is at a threat of crashing?

XRP,2025-01-11,comment,XRP,Comment on: Why XRP Could Hit $100 (and Why Market Cap Doesn't...,"first of all, I do own an interesting bag of XRP.

Now the reality, I keep seeing similar posts all the time, not only here but also in other social media, and it is always the same argument ""if institutions adopt..."" ""if XRP process a fraction of the global....."" and all the other statements.

Do I want XRP to go to USD 100?  Sure, USD 1000?  of course.  Could it happen?  Hopefully yes, but realistically you will have to convince first the institutions to give up the billion of dollars they make by charging for those transactions.  I just look up, Wells Fargo charges USD 11 to send money to Central America.  Until last year they were only charging USD 8.  This is only for personal, imagine what are the charges for actual institutions.  Do you think they would easily give up those fees voluntarily?  Hell no, they will keep milking until they can't anymore.

Are there institutions using crypto to transfer money around the world? Absolutely, and the chances are it is not via XRP.

Anyway, I love how positive and hopeful the XRP community is, but we do have to understand the different levels of the existing business, and banks won't change one method by another unless there is something for them to make money.",5

1. Does the use of XRP to execute these payments burn the XRP? Example, If I use 100 XRP to facilitate payment, are those 100 XRP burned/erased from total supply? Or do those 100 XRP simply get transferred to the receiving entity and can be used again?

2. What is stopping other companies/governments from creating a new coin with the exact same utility as XRP? If I’m the banks/governments, I don’t want to adopt a coin that thousands(millions?) of other people already own and I have to pay a higher price for.

Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Officially Settled – $XRP Community, It’s Over

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just published Litigation Release No. 26306 confirming that Ripple Labs, Inc., Brad Garlinghouse, and Chris Larsen have reached a settlement agreement with the Commission.

Key points from the official SEC release (May 8, 2025):
> Ripple will pay $50 million to the SEC as a final civil penalty.
> The remaining $75 million (previously held in escrow) will be returned to Ripple.
> Both Ripple and the SEC will drop their appeals currently pending before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
> The injunction against Ripple from the 2024 judgment will be dissolved.
> The SEC emphasizes this is a strategic resolution, not a concession on the legal classification of XRP.

“The Commission’s decision… rests on its judgment that such resolution will facilitate the Commission’s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry.”

This marks the end of a years-long legal battle that has shaped much of the regulatory uncertainty around crypto in the U.S. While the debate over XRP’s status isn’t fully resolved, this is a massive milestone for Ripple and the broader Web3 space.",119

XRP,2024-08-19,post,XRP,Historical Price Valuation XRP vs Bitcoin,"I am an extreme newbie to XRP. I have been dazzled by its promise and utility and its low entry price. I had some time off work so I dove deep into XRP. While down my rabbit hole I kept seeing individuals saying there is no possibility for over $10 due to market cap or other reasons. It got me wondering what was being said about Bitcoin (price predictions) before its meteoric rise. I went on Wayback Time Machine to read some old articles in the era of 2011-2014. I went on Bloomberg and Yahoo Business and it was very hard to find any predictions at all. I was just wondering if anyone knows of any major naysayers back in the day that spewed the same crap that is said today about XRP. I know about Peter Schiff and others, but I can't recall the backlash against Bitcoin like there is against XRP. I mean everyone and their brother bashes it! I have already bought in over the weekend, but I am definitely here to learn. I just thought if I could find some articles that stated the same blather about Bitcoin back in the day I could relate it to XRP and correlate it to show a possible meteoric rise of XRP. Anyway...excuse my ignorance on the coin as I am a Newbie as of this weekend. Thanks!",47
XRP,2024-08-19,comment,XRP,Comment on: Historical Price Valuation XRP vs Bitcoin...,"I used to work at a bank back in 2009. My coworker's husband purchased $500 worth of Bitcoin that year, and he came into the bank trying to tell us about it. The way he explained Bitcoin made zero sense, it sounded like he didn't really understand it himself, and he told us we should buy in. He told us that if we bought as much as he did, that we would be millionaires at some point.  
  
We all laughed it off, his wife complained about how he wasted money on it for several weeks afterwards. That was the first time I ever heard the word ""cryptocurrency"", and back then at 20 years old, I couldn't wrap my brain around the concept of it - especially since I worked at a bank. To me, money was money! We all convinced ourselves that her husband was swindled by some nerd he worked with. He ended up sending back $400 or so and kept a small holding, just to see what would happen.

For me the market cap argument for xrp does not work quite as well as Bitcoin because xrp is a utility token. It's more for banks to facilitate transfer than for retail to own and use. While that is the case or can be the case it wasn't meant to be the case. 

Xrp price is ultimately decided by the utility (how much adoption for bank and how much usage). The price is higher if it is more utilized and desired and is used to conduct large transactions. It's more efficient to send trillions if xrp price is 10k or 100k then 60 cent. A ripple exec (I think Chris Larsen) says it best. We are not measuring xrp price as an indicator of success of our company. We are focusing on building relationship (1700 NDA contracts and counting) increasing adoptions, and the price increase will follow. He anticipated that xrp price will be very ""healthy"", once the network is in place.",3

XRP,2024-11-22,comment,XRP,"Comment on: New Study Predicts XRP Could Reach Up to $22,000 W...",Market cap is overrated. Yearly world banks transactions are at least 27 trillion. Wallstreet alone 1 quadrillion. If 10% goes through Xrp ripple net then $22000/xrp isn't farfetched. Plus ripple has a burning mechanism in place. The adoptions might take time to fully materialize.,6

In my mind banks needing to stockpile XRP for ODL would be the catalyst for a parabolic upswing but I'd also assume those transactions would be backroom deals to keep the price form going bonkers because if they weren't the appeal of adoption would go down with every bank that bought a supply.

XRP,2025-01-27,post,XRP,What do you think about this XRP price calculation?,"Hi everybody, 

Please let me know what you think about this XRP calculation where I considered XRP absorbs 1% ($10 tri) of the global market ($1 quad) by 2035. I added burn to the transactions but I believe the effect is minimal since banks can consolidate daily transaction reducing the burn. I also used liquidity and non-liquidity to calculate the price ranges. The main focus should be on 2025 and 2035 since the years in between are just a linear bridge. I also used bitcoin at $500k in 2035 for comparison.

Let me know what you think.",9

XRP,2025-01-28,comment,XRP,Comment on: What do you think about this XRP price calculation...,"@OP it contains a flaw in your assumption that renders it useless to be honest, because you show you don’t understand the use case.
You assume XRP reaches a % value of the global financial market which implies XRP will replace the current fiat values
Let’s be clear, XRP is a utility token for financial transactions - it is not going to replace the market as such so assuming it does x % of the global financial market is wrong.

XRP going to be used is in transactions, if you assume it will replace a % of the global transaction market, in number of transactions by using xrp, you can start to factor in the burn rate per transaction.
The latter will have marginal effect on the number of tokens in supply for many years to come.

What give the coin value is speculation at the moment and we all ride the wave. 
With the use case in mind you can argue that all these predictions of ridiculous coin values are plain stupid because it will add cost to the transactions so if the value is insane, it will not be used for the one thing it is designed for - lightning fast transactions at virtually zero cost.

You can argue that over time the demand for the token goes up because banks need it for the transactions which will increase buying pressure and will affect price - but keep in mind that the supply available for trading and use will increase massively as well.",2

XRP,2024-12-06,post,XRP,$13.50 by Feb 14,"XRP Team, 

The XRP train is only just starting to leave the station, and there’s no stopping it. Here’s why I categorically believe that XRP will reach $13.50 by Mid-February 2025. 

1. RLUSD Is Just Days Away

Ripple’s game-changing RLUSD stablecoin is on the brink of launch. This will revolutionize global liquidity solutions, cementing XRP as the backbone of the new financial system. The market is already whispering…days from now, the stablecoin landscape will change forever.

2. Brad Garlinghouse on 60 Minutes This Sunday

When the CEO of Ripple appears on one of the most respected platforms in the world, you KNOW something big is happening. This is not just publicity; it’s validation of Ripple’s dominance in the financial space. Expect the world to wake up to XRP’s potential. Your local butcher will be asking you how to buy XRP on Monday, because of this groundbreaking interview.

3. Crypto Czar in the White House

Our new Crypto Czar David Sacks is openly pro-XRP, a signal that regulatory clarity is not only on the way, but about to change the way the United States government both views and uses digital assets. Sacks will literally 180 Gensler’s anti-crypto stance on January 20th and open the floodgates for Ripple and investors. 

4. Gensler  Out, Pro-XRP SEC Chair In

New SEC Chair Paul Atkinson is a known Ripple supporter. This will end the anti-crypto stance and usher in a new era of partnerships, legitimizing XRP like never before.

5. Trump’s Crypto Agenda

With Trump back in power, pro-crypto policies are coming. The administration has hinted at blockchain innovation as a cornerstone of economic growth. Trump has quietly expressed interest in Ripple’s technology, positioning XRP for massive adoption.

6. Elon Musk + Ripple Tech = X Payments Revolution

Elon Musk is widely rumoured to be eyeing Ripple’s tech to power X Payments. Imagine the world’s largest payment platform leveraging XRP for instant, cost-effective transactions. This isn’t speculation—it’s the future being built before our eyes.

7. This Is a No-Brainer

XRP is trading at $2.35 today. But let’s be very fucking clear; this is just the calm before the storm. The convergence of regulatory clarity, corporate adoption, and game-changing partnerships is creating the perfect environment for $13.50 (and possibly beyond) by Valentine’s Day 2025.

XRP,2024-08-09,post,XRP,Fix my math (xrp real value),"Swift moves $5 trillion every day. That's $60 million per second. The xrpl can process a transaction every 2-4 seconds, so every 2-4 seconds an xrp token can be reused in the liquidity pool, but during that time it's use is tied up. 

$60M x 4 seconds =$240M on average tied up in xrp at all times

$240M divided by the available xrp gives the required price of xrp to process 100% of swift transactions. 

If only 1% of xrp is in the pool (out of 100B) then $240,000,000 / 1B xrp = $.24

Am I getting something wrong? Others say it needs to be $10k to work right.

So the liquidity has to cover the biggest transaction.  $60 million is average and if implementing splitting, you lock the liquidity for any other concurrent transactions which would make the system slower than SWIFT in worst case scenario.

Say biggest transaction is 10B and only 1% XRP is used then you have $10 per coin.  $10K is the most optimistic scenario. Floor price is very likely to be at least $10.",7

XRP,2024-08-10,comment,XRP,Comment on: Fix my math (xrp real value)...,"I'm glad other folks are beginning to understand this.

Yes, xrp will have a ""barebones"" base value or intrinsic value much lower than the spot price, due to the speed at which transactions resolve and ledgers close which will impact immediate liquidity and supply+demand.

However, intangibles like reliability, lower fees, higher speed, ease of use + swapping, liquidity, FOMO, and hype will serve to raise the price.

If you look at a stock, its spot price is comprised of not only its material asset net worth, but also its reputation in the industry, lawsuits its involved in, general market sentiment, and what investors feel about regarding its future performance. I'm rusty on my economic terms, but as memory serves, a sound investment is usually priced at 20x its current ""actual"" value. Anything less is considered a great deal. Global currencies really aren't any different. Their spot price is comprised of material factors, comparative factors, sentiment, and futures.

All that said, this is why xrp paired with a usd-backed stablecoin like RLUSD has the potential to blow the lid. As more Real World Assets are tokenized, they will serve to ""soak up"" and saturate the xrp market in terms of xrp being used in transactions at any one time. Eventually, I foresee crypto and blockchains like the XRPL tokenizing not only safe RWAs like T-Bills and rendering smart contracts, but outright swallowing and tokenizing all stock markets and all material wealth. I see crypto ETFs as sort of a snake eating its own tail situation. It will initially help to build confidence in the infrastructure and be used *by* the stock markets, and then its blockchains will tokenize and consume the stock markets and the world's wealth, sector by sector.

By buying xrp, you've bought a tanker full of gas for people to pay for their asset's trip. Given a higher demand for your gas, you should expect to be able to make some amount of profit should you choose to convert your gas to some other asset. As Ripple's reputation improves and the XRPL's reliability and robustness are affirmed, all of the same soft factors that boost a stock or a currency should be reflected in xrp price.",5

XRP,2024-08-10,comment,XRP,Comment on: Fix my math (xrp real value)...,"So… with the current circulating supply if XRP had Bitcoins market cap the price would be just shy of $20 assuming the trade availability retains a similar spread and conditions as Bitcoin. Now you can almost halve that number to $10 once all the escrow is released BUT it’ll climb as XRP is burned. XRP does have the best legal framework to finally begin contesting against BTC. 

Regardless, the price per token is irrelevant for either crypto because you can buy in fractions. You can view 1 BTC as 1/19M of a single BTC, or p/n, and scale it to any value retaining the same ratio. Likewise with XRP, you can view it as 1/55b of a single XRP. 

Instead, you should be looking at how much value you have in it and the potential for growth in percentages as you would have the same growth from the same amount of value of BTC as XRP, or any other asset. The potential of the asset itself is what is important, not the cost of an individual piece of an asset, especially when that asset can be subdivided to smaller pieces anyways. ",1

The theoretical price in this scenario would be approximately $50 per XRP, assuming stable market conditions and sufficient liquidity.

Pleas...","The Annual Christmas Sell Off - If you don’t know what you’re doing, and you don’t have a plan, you shouldn’t be in crypto(for shorts and timing the market); so do as many do and just buy some coins and sit on them. Set a target what you think is a fair exit then wait for that day.

I can’t afford to run losses so I don’t “trade”. just because the price rebounds to a new low for a day or so doesn’t mean gloom. Some time buying in, if you’re like me I watch. Zoom out I say because every single asset followed some kind of btc flow these last 48 hours. All paired assets down by x% Like when will that ever change we don’t know. 

But holding and watching the return is a fun ride, going to 440% monthly from November 9 was quite the achievement I reckon two or three major upswings before Christmas / New Year should make it bounce right back and beyond

XRP,2025-01-21,post,XRP,Rugpulling Regime. ,"I'm neither an American nor an expert but I have enough brain to do due diligence. For months, I have been researching about XRP and Ripple. It's one of the most logical crypto currencies ever. Ripple's technology coupled with its ecosystem is very good, and that makes XRP, a very logical and mindful investment. 

Things looked good as Trump was endorsing crypto and wanted to make America, the crypto capital of the World. However, the past few days, the shenanigans, him, Melania and his advisor (Ryan Fournier) have done will have major consequences. You simply cannot be doing that shit when you're about to be sworn-in as the President of one of the most influential, if not, the most influential country in the World.

I genuinely hope that he pulls his head out of his ass and stops fucking around with this. Crypto itself is not looked at as a serious investment by an average ""joe"", and shit like this, will make people never take good stuff like XRP seriously.",684

XRP,2025-01-18,post,XRP,my thoughts on crazy prices for XRP,"been looking at crypto for about 4 years. the biggest contradiction I have observed on the value of the tokens is utilization vs asset growth.

here me out. 

specifically speaking, for the tokens in the top 50 or even 100 by market cap, they are largely driven by expectations of initial investors. initial investors here can be simply referred to anyone who buys into crypto tokens where the market cap outweighs the actual monetary rewards the blockchain/system/apps are making.

For this case, XRP has about 200 billion in market cap, in contrast a company with 200 billion in market cap would be one of the top 500 companies in the world. much of the value in Xrp is without a doubt driven by initial investors hoping that the actual market utilisation and they get to profit off capital gains.

With its massive following, it accumulate a large pool of token holders and investors. Because of this pool of accumulated funds, financial institutions are joining in. However, while these FIs sing to the tune of the initial investors, the underlying objective is to profit off these huge piles of currency reserves sitting within the XRP pool, and also to obtain access to these investors. initial investors of crypto typically fall within the profile of one who is young, having a higher investment risk profile, certain degree of recklessness, or pioneer mentality (not herd), or a combination of the above. These demographics are coincidentally the target demographics of FIs selling investment products, hope you get my point here.

lastly, as a food for thought, capital appreciation for crypto is in a similar manner to gold, as an alternative investment to holding currencies and provides for capital gains. large banks hold tonnes of gold, do they use gold certs to replace any interbank transaction fees? essentially it is possible since modern gold is mostly paper gold, much like crypto is simply is string of alphanumeric deciphered only by its algorithm. 

will we really reach a stage where global wide utilisation of crypto becomes a reality? much like. FIs holding gold reserves as a safeguard against global crisis, I would think the golden era of crypto should only be triggered by a similar event. ",0

I hope this explains how I view the markets bearishness in context of a larger timeframe perspective. Just in general when there's a huge move in any given month the market often re-offers price somewhere in that range to permit others to get positions in where otherwise they wouldn't through fear of ""chasing price"". This isn't so much for us individual traders, but for bigger money who require that drop to build positions. Still, it's very much something each of us can benefit from.

That being said, the reaction from this month's candle dropping and creating the wick is very strong in favour of higher movement for this and next month. ",41

XRP,2025-04-26,post,XRP,Blink and you'll miss it.,"The ones paying attention already know. The rest will find out too late:

XRP and the Iraqi dinar revaluation are tied up — and it’s already moving behind the scenes.
•Iraq didn’t spend years upgrading their banks just to wire money the old way.
•Ripple already locked down the Middle East corridors — UAE, Saudi, Jordan — they’re plugged in.
•Iraq’s new system? ISO 20022 ready. That’s XRP’s playground.

When Iraq flips the switch on the dinar, they’re gonna need to move real money, fast and clean.
They’re not waiting on 3-day bank wires.
They’re not running billions through broken SWIFT rails.

The liquidity’s already there.
The corridors are already built.
XRP’s been sitting there like a loaded gun, waiting for someone to pull the trigger.

That’s why CME just dropped XRP futures without a peep from the SEC.
They’re not hyping it.
They’re loading it.

IQD moves.
Liquidity explodes.
XRP absorbs it — quietly at first, then violently when the charts catch up.

Don’t expect a press conference.
Expect a moment where the market blinks… and it’s already too late to catch the move.

You probably *should* be buying the heavy drops, because big money are scaling in long positions right now. Better buying now, rather than later when the folks chasing price action are getting in at higher prices.

XRP,2024-12-05,post,XRP,J.P. Morgan chase bank wants xrp,"Did yall know they tried to buy ALL 50 billion in escrow from ripple? (Source: xrp unleashed) I’ve done so much research to try and understand how likely it is for xrp to reach high numbers like $10,000 or more. Here’s my opinion. It all comes down to its use as bridge currency, its partnership with swift and how banks adopt xrp. XRP is partners with over 100 banks but swift is over 11,000. So there are only two real options here, either XRP becomes the bridge currency for 11,000 banks not by taking over swift but working with them or XRP is completely worthless. Considering ripple is working with swift and adding a new bank every week… chances are everyone is correct about XRP and it’s going to $10,000 or higher. It’ll take time but we might be holding one of the most undervalued assets in the world. (Also retail investors don’t fully understand market cap, it’s not something you NEED it’s something you HAVE. Market cap does not equal the amount of money invested into an asset by retail traders. Common misconception.) in reality you would only need about 130 billion to buy up all the XRP in circulation but then it would be impossible for retail to buy it… as it’s been said before “ in order for XRP to function properly the price need to be very high” not just for supply but liquidity. $10,000 to $50,000 XRP in the next 10 to 25 years unless adoption is fast tracked.

So 2 things, either a major collapse is coming or they use xrp as their bridge. I’m sure there’s more coins/projects that can be used but I’m betting xrp is the main one. It’s been in the game the longest and is more trusted.  I also saw that by 2026 January, the basal III committee will have their requirements in place for what type of crypto assets can be used by banks. I’m sure they’ll need to be iso compliant. This thing is going to blow. Many people don’t pay attention to what’s going on. They just think of crypto as a casino but if they just stop for a second and look at the world around them. These people have literally been telling us this was coming for years.  The iso 20022 standard is over 20 years old. We just didn’t have the infrastructure for them to implement it. ",60

If all bitcoin was liquidated there would not be 2 trillion dollars in funds. And that's a fundamental fact.

Markets cap is how valuations were calculationed in the legacy system.
The digital system will be a whole different animal becuz it will allow a much larger amount of assets to be be traded without old legacy system friction. 

Settlement time, and balancing of ledgers causes the most friction. 
In a digital system that will be effortless

Market cap will be completely disregarded, or not hold as much weight as today, in the coming years when quadrillions of Dirivatives are created to tokenize gold, silver, natural gas, oil, real-estate, fine art, etc. On blockchain.

Vitalik has been quoted as saying XRP is the internet of value. Black rock changed their mind about crypto once they understood rwa tokenization. Black rock is working with securitize, and securitize’s CEO and co-founder spoke at Swell

The idea of xrp being able to scale to meet demand is the money maker. I believe it’s what will push it to high prices ($5T daily @ 50B tokens = $100 etc). It’s what everyone talks about. It makes us feel like we’re not crazy. The impressive thing to me these days is what’s happening behind the scenes, but right in front of our face. The tokenization of everything. Real estate is $300T alone. How it’ll affect XRP I don’t know, but I know I’d like to find out. I’m not worried about price. Its not up to us, what will be will be.

My question is, the last 2 runs both lasted 2 to 3 weeks only. What in your opinion makes this time different?

Just asking to get everyone thinking differently. One thing I can think of is that SEC case really screwed the last bull run. Even so, most coins don't run hard for extended time. Again, past doesn't necessarily predict future. Just wanting to hear your thoughts.

I get all the upcoming catalysts like stable coin and Trump, etc. The flip side is there's buying rumor selling news. Again, just wanting a healthy discussion.",7

I have my plan which has already grown my portfolio to more money I’ve ever had in my life.  

Honestly kind of kicking myself for not buying more solana and bitcoin.  I have a number of coins I’m going to save a portion of for the long run, XRP being one. Some I’m not going to sell at all this bull run.  BTC and SOL are two and I just wish I had more.  I felt like I was better offer making more faster instead of did just putting it all into BTC.",1

I have fairly humble XRP holdings, but enough that an XRP moonshot would be worth a substantial amount. However, I always see the point brought up that market cap and the amount of XRP in circulation make it mathematically and fundamentally impossible for XRP to be worth anything over $100/token.

Then I hear counterarguments saying that market cap doesn't apply to XRP, and that the utility is the only thing that matters. People also say that if XRP were to be widely adopted, the price per token would ""need"" to be high ($1,000+), but I thought the Ripple CTO said that the price per token wouldn't need to be crazy high for XRP to still function. 

Can anyone explain this more thoroughly to someone like me, who isn't as well-versed in things like market cap and cryptos in general?

Thanks in advance.",392
XRP,2025-03-07,comment,XRP,"Comment on: How could XRP $1,000+ happen?...","I got you OP!

This comment by [Imaginary\_Ad5147](https://www.reddit.com/user/Imaginary_Ad5147/) should sum it up for you :)

Sometimes I get tired of this question being asked over and over again, but this is the place to do it. It’s good you’re asking in a genuine way because a lot of times it’s worded poorly and the informed people here don’t want to answer. I hope this clarifies how xrp works:

Let’s say $100 billion needs to be moved by banks through the use of xrp. There are 100 billion tokens. That means at $1 they would need to use all 100 billion tokens in existence. Let’s say we factor in available tokens of the circulating supply (not held by retail, banks, institutions, etfs, etps, and ripple etc) now we get a much smaller number. Let’s say 50 billion circ supply goes down to 30 billion. Now that $1 xrp is now $3. Now let’s say banks are moving on the ledger what swift moves in a day which is $5 trillion. This is the milestone many in the community look towards. That $3 token is now $133

JP Morgan facilitates $10 trillion worth of payments per day. Their MC is not $10 trillion. If a token were used to facilitate these payments, and there were 50 billion of these tokens available how much would that token need to be worth to move that amount of money? $200. What about 40B tokens, 30B, 25B, you get the idea. Banks won’t sell any tokens being used for payments, just to buy them back again for payments. So those tokens are just being circulated within the ecosystem, forever shrinking due to burning. The top 5 banks in the US move approx $40T a day. That’s just the US. $50T @ 25B available tokens is $2k a token

I am not saying xrp will be at a circulating supply of 25B and will be moving $50T. This is just easy numbers to explain the mechanics of how xrp can scale to large amounts in order to move money around the world. I think the next two years will be very interesting in the utility space, with the big winners being xrp as well as a handful of others that offer true utility and value. We have never had price action due to utility and not trading volume, but I believe it will shatter most of the current thoughts on crypto, and the role of MC and supply

RWA tokenization is a whole nother beast, and is over $2 quadrillion, which the XRPL is expected to gain a market share of. That’s probably better left for another post. Best of luck",547

XRP,2025-03-07,comment,XRP,"Comment on: How could XRP $1,000+ happen?...","Apparently, if global banks and institutions start using XRP moving large amounts of money, its price will naturally rise due to increased demand and limited supply. As XRP's price goes up, fewer tokens will be needed for transactions, making large-scale transfers more efficient. For example... 

At £1 per XRP, moving £1 trillion would require 1 trillion XRP (not feasible).

At £1,000 per XRP, moving £1 trillion would only require 1 billion XRP which is much more manageable.

I'm still unsure about this though, hopefully it's true though 😅

Update - The Bank of England's Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system processed an average of £748.6 billion per day in Q4 2024 and that's just the bank of England... Doesn't seem to unrealistic when you see the amount of money they're handling per day 🤯",30

The reserve bank of India proposed a digital rupee cbdc.  Sbi has proposed a yen stablecoin and predicts all Japanese banks to use xrpl in 2025 etc.

Well, first off the United States has stated they’re not going to pursue a central bank digital currency however they don’t rule out the use of bank/private issued stable coins. XRP runs on the XRP ledger, which is distributed ledger technology.  This means you can have multiple private ledges connecting to the main one allowing countries that want to pursue a CBdc and have more control over their local currency can do so while ones that want normal stables to also do so. All bridged seamlessly using xrp as an intermediary. The automated market maker is coded to always use XRP as the most liquid hop and this does a few things. First off at minimizes the amount of needed liquidity pools to maintain rates and swap liquidity. Instead of each stable coin having an individual liquidity pool with every other stable coin it will only have to maintain one between it and XRP.   This massively reduces circulating supply and drives demand as it is used for transfer and tokenization fees which are burned meaning further albeit more gradual supply loss.    Meaning much higher prices at a lower market cap.  I think at a point it will back itself. For example the rlusd stablecoin by ripple is already backed 1-1 by usd so unlike terra Luna it doesn’t rely on xrp to maintain price. Just for swaps between stables.  As they go live my opinion is Tvl (total value locked) explodes and price follows

Edit and all this is before we talk about the tokenization of real world assets.  There are already treasury bonds being traded on xrpl. Securities and derivatives all of which can be tokenized are another multi quadrillion dollar market  with a q .",7

XRP,2025-03-07,comment,XRP,"Comment on: How could XRP $1,000+ happen?...","Market cap is how we value our companies. But, doesn't directly translate over to cryptocurrency.

XRP,2025-03-07,comment,XRP,"Comment on: How could XRP $1,000+ happen?...","The term market cap is in place rn because there is no other way to measure the worth of something.

When a company is divided into the shares, it's calculated by the company worth.

For eg:-, a company is worth 1000$ and wants 10 shares of each, so each share is worth 100$.

Companies already have their worth before shares thats why its calculated as market cap....

But with crypto, it's a bit different. Its supply and demand game. It's like how much people are willing to pay for it.

For eg :-, a coin is 10$, and there are only 10 coins in the market. So they calculated the market cap to 100$.

Shares are divided by the existing market cap. But for crypto, curriences have their value, and they calculate its market cap. Hope it helps.",8

XRP,2024-12-14,comment,XRP,Comment on: How does the ripple stable coin do anything to XRP...,"What?

No. 

XRP is a utility token. 

It is used to transport a single payment transaction between A & B parties. 

It does this by converting the sender’s RLUSD stable coin into a XRP token to transfer the payment to the recipient’s account during the exchange. 

The XRP is converted back into the RLUSD stable coin once it arrives at the receiver’s account. 

Every time a payment transaction happens on XRP, a portion of the XRP token used to transport the payment is burned. 

That small portion…very small portion can never be used again. 

Supply and demand!

With trillions of payment transactions happening on the older Swift platform that major financial institutions use today, XRP stands to gain more value as these major financial institutions adopt XRP protocol to make payments between their financial systems.

It’s a utility like electricity is a utility. 

Turn on a light - 💡- the electricity used to keep the light on can’t be used again! Same for XRP transporting payments across networks - once a payment transfer is made - the portion of XRP used to transfer the payment can’t be used ever again.",1

Now for my hypotheses  and raving lunacies.  Ripple got sued by the SEC,  part of Judge Torres decision required them to pay an exorbitant amount of money to the govt.   Now if Trump gets Ripple to pay off this debt via XRP he could aquire a substantial amount without impacting the markets.   He would then put it in the reserve where it would be untouched.  

 This would crunch the supply of XRP immensely.   Small holders would quickly get priced out. Most people will sell along the way having made life changing money. 

But with this supply in the reserves, the U.S. debt would be balanced against it lowering our debt to asset ratio.  XRP ""works best at higher values"" since large institutions don't want their transfers losing value every 10 seconds.

But I mostly see people talking about buying dips and ‘shares’ with all of their life savings hoping they will get rich quick. 

But I don’t see nearly as many talking about what they’re actually buying. If your entire strategy is ‘buy low, sell high,’ ask yourself: where does the money come from?

If the only reason you think XRP will go up is because someone else will buy it for more later, that’s not investing—it’s gambling on finding a greater fool. Eventually, someone is left holding the bag. Are you sure it won’t be you?

Add tokenization. Plus tokenization hype.

It'll reach $100+ in 2027

Only thing that matters is it should be above $20 soon.
Rest is history.

When you make any investment and don’t want to flake out on it, you just need to research it.  

Look for red flags. Seriously try to find the bear case. Try to find the flaws. Look for what can happen in the worst case scenario….

I can’t find it with Ripple / XRP Ledger / XRP….  

There was one event that happened recently. (It was) The 64 minute failure to recognize validating nodes on Tuesday or Wednesday. 

I sold out when I saw it. Was at 2.50.  Took profit, but I’m not going to ride an investment into the ground. 

I didn’t sell on the dip to 1.78 because that was based on tariff speculation. I bought more below 2.07. 

I’m not a diamond handed ape. If 💩happens that f’s with  fundamentals, that a concern. 

I expected a massive drop. To me, that was the first red flag I have seen. After looking into it, it wasn’t any sort of problem.

Since then I have been buying back in. While only 10 -15 pennies cheaper and reducing my max position to only house money (only risking profit, made 12k usd, only risking that so fear is removed from the equation).

5k coin at 2.30. If it drops below 2$ again, I will get back to 10k coin. (Unless there is a breakdown / change in fundamentals).",10

XRP,2025-05-13,post,XRP,Is this confirmed?,"Is XRP Expected to Be Used by All Japanese Domestic Banks by End of 2025?

Yes, the Bank of Japan has announced that all domestic banks in Japan are set to fully adopt Ripple’s XRP for payment systems by the end of 2025. This move is being driven by SBI Holdings and marks a major step in blockchain adoption within the Japanese banking sector.

Expected Yearly Volume in Dollars
Japan’s banking sector processes massive transaction volumes. The total value of the sector is estimated at $6.37 trillion. However, the annual payment and settlement volume through domestic banks is much higher, with estimates suggesting it could exceed $27 trillion USD yearly, based on interbank settlement data and conversion from yen to dollars.

I asked perplexity about this and this is the answer i got, anyone know if this is confimed?",452
XRP,2025-05-13,comment,XRP,Comment on: Is this confirmed?...,"Not so fast.  A quick Google search refutes this claim. Potential but not certain and nothing in writing.

Potential for Broader Adoption:

SBI Holdings CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao, has been a vocal supporter of XRP and has expressed optimism about its potential for broader adoption by Japanese banks.

Reports have suggested that Kitao predicted up to 80% of Japanese banks would be using XRP by 2025, although these claims lack definitive verification.

A Nasdaq article from January 2025 stated that nearly 80% of Japanese banks are expected to integrate Ripple's solutions by 2025, which could potentially include XRP.

However, it's important to note that many banks might be utilizing RippleNet, which doesn't necessarily involve the use of XRP itself, according to Digital One Agency. ",148

Network congestion is what really causes the fees and burn rate to moon. There was an article about an ETH whale who fat fingered a gas fee that was higher than the amount transacted. I think the transfer was like $1 million ETH and the gas fee was $4 million lol.

I could be completely mistaken so forgive me.

But I would just like to know, if that is the case, if the coins being burned will lead to a lower supply and therefore a higher demand therefore a higher price.

If I’m mistaken, can someone explain how it will actually lead to the price of XRP increasing?

XRP,2024-12-11,comment,XRP,Comment on: How are RLUSD and XRP actually linked? How would b...,"Well, at least you're questioning the explanations you've been reading. The burn of fees will be negligible on supply so that will not drive xrp price. 

RLUSD won't directly affect xrp price. There's no explanation anywhere that it will. No marble or toys analogy explains it and it's amazing that so many people don't understand simple economics and finance. 

XRP is best for cross boarder bridge for 2 currencies. RLUSD is only one currency so it won't bridge anything on its own. It's real primary use can be seen on the ripple site - quick payments (in usd). If it's to enable ODL and increase xrp price, another foreign stable coin has to be implemented on the receiver end. Now, if this does happen and every currency in the world has its own stablecoin, this doesn't solve the cross border problem on its own. It would still need xrp as a bridge because that's where the liquidity is built. You can imagine there would be a massive lack of liquidity in direct stablecoin currency pairs. 

But as it is on its own RLUSD won't affect xrp price outside of retail speculation. ",7

As I've understood, it would be extremely inefficient to send $100k RLUSD from A->B if:

1  xrp=1$  it would need 100k coins/tokens of xrp. 

However if

1 xrp=10k you'd need 10 coins/tokens

All of this would depend on how much RLUSD is adopted globally.

We will see what happens in the end, but if anyone was up to the job of kicking that first domino over, it is DJT. 
When this is all said and done, we will have a way less lopsided playing field, and that will positively affect all of us in very big ways. We just have to be patient. I mean the price of gold is even down, so just breathe. This had to happen.
 
I think we will see Trump extend a zero for zero policy back to Israel today, and I think that the EU will follow suit in the coming days. China is the wild card in my opinion. Trump is playing an extra tough hand with them, and rightfully so, but who knows how they will react. 

The American economy is extremely important to China. So, I'd have a hard time believing China does anything but sign a fair trade agreement. They will not spit in the face of America, at least I don't think they will. President Trump is forcing the world to play fair.

XRP,2024-12-14,post,XRP,How can RLUSD raise the price of XRP?,"The relationship between RLUSD (likely Reserve Lending USD) and XRP pricing can be linked to factors like liquidity, utility, and market sentiment. Here's how RLUSD might influence XRP's price:

1. Increased Liquidity for XRP:
If RLUSD offers lending or borrowing services backed by XRP, it could increase demand for XRP as collateral, thus reducing its supply on exchanges and driving the price up.


2. Strengthened Use Case:
RLUSD could enhance XRP’s utility by integrating it into broader financial ecosystems, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) or cross-border payment networks. This creates more reasons for people to buy and hold XRP, supporting price appreciation.


3. Market Sentiment Boost:
The adoption of RLUSD for XRP-related activities could signal increased trust and development in the XRP ecosystem. Positive sentiment often leads to higher trading volumes and price increases.


4. Decreased Sell Pressure:
If RLUSD holders use XRP for staking, lending, or liquidity provision instead of selling it, this reduces sell pressure in the market, potentially increasing the price.


5. Utility in Stablecoin Markets:
RLUSD could enable easier transactions or settlements in ecosystems leveraging XRP, indirectly tying XRP’s price performance to the growth and adoption of RLUSD.



To assess RLUSD’s impact on XRP's price, monitor partnerships, liquidity pool sizes, and the role XRP plays in RLUSD’s broader framework. If RLUSD fosters a thriving XRP ecosystem, it could positively influence XRP's market dynamics.

XRP,2025-05-24,post,XRP,Reality check,"Think $XRP is going to $1,000 after the SEC case wraps up? 
Time for a reality check❗️

Let’s talk supply first: with nearly 100 billion tokens in circulation, a $1,000 price tag would put XRP’s market cap at over $100 trillion — that’s more than the entire planet’s GDP 🌍💸. It’s just not feasible.

Even hitting $10 or $50 is a major stretch with the current market dynamics 📉.

Sure, XRP could possibly climb above $10 if massive institutional investment or bank partnerships flood in… but let’s be honest:

Why would major players jump in while the SEC drama continues after all these years? ⚖️⌛

And if it did spike to double digits, many retail investors would likely sell off fast, triggering a massive correction 💼📉.

Bottom line? Stop dreaming about $1,000 moonshots 🚀.",206

Market Cap is just an arbitrary figure that's calculated at the most recent market transactions. Because the demand may still be high while the available supply shortens, tokens cost more.

If market cap was to be considered a reliable indicator of how much money has been spent purchasing xrp tokens then wouldn't every token cost the same price as the market cap just went higher?

Things like liquidity, or tracking the inflows are much more reliable. But the reality is, market cap is made up by the automated market maker and could some day even blow past the global GDP. Hypothetically, if the available supply dwindles down to the last million or even 1000 tokens, it will cost an absolute fortune. And every other token out there will be valued at the same price, because that's the effect of how the market cap is calculated.",16

Nothing concrete has come from these SEC meetings and I bet tomorrow is just a bunch of bureaucrats talking about how important crypto is. The government moves horrifically slow. I'm of the mindset you can't have enough xrp but don't think tomorrow will revolutionize crypto, let alone XRP. Don't make impulsive decisions based on hopes and dreams. Buy if you think it's logical, but don't make decisions on emotions.

I hope I'm wrong but I was invested in XRP before the lawsuit even started. This is a LONGGGGGG ride. If Trump snapped his fingers and everything was instantly peachy that would be awesome. But that's not going to happen. ",475
XRP,2025-03-06,comment,XRP,Comment on: Don't get too excited...," I get where you’re coming from, but honestly, things are moving a lot faster than most people realize. 

  There’s already legislative initiatives making their way through Congress, and the fact that we even have discussions on a crypto strategic reserve…with XRP being the first named, is massive. 

 On top of that, look at how quickly other SEC cases have been dropped. There’s clearly a bigger plan in motion.

The SEC case against Ripple? That’s being held back strategically imo. Why? Because timing is everything. The president knows exactly what he’s doing, and they’re playing this out methodically. 

As of March 6, 2025, several legislative initiatives concerning cryptocurrency are progressing through the U.S. Congress:


	1.	Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21): This bill, introduced in July 2023, aims to delineate regulatory responsibilities between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning digital assets. It proposes that the CFTC oversee digital commodities, while the SEC regulates digital securities. The House of Representatives passed the bill in May 2024 with bipartisan support, and it is currently under Senate consideration. ￼


	2.	Stablecoin Regulation: Congress is working on legislation to regulate stablecoins as payment methods. This initiative seeks to address consumer protection concerns and the potential risks associated with stablecoins, especially given past failures like Terra and Voyager. The proposed regulations aim to make stablecoins more competitive with traditional bank deposits. ￼


	3.	Anti-Debanking Bill: Republican senators, led by Senator Tim Scott, have introduced the Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act. This bill aims to prevent banks from denying services to certain businesses, including cryptocurrency firms, based on reputational risks. The legislation seeks to focus regulatory oversight on financial conditions and legal compliance rather than subjective reputational considerations.

 What we are seeing is unprecedented momentum, and that should be more than enough to be confident in the direction we’re headed.

Also, the new SEC chair Atkins is not actually guranteed yet he still requires approval in the senate so if Trump is blatantly abusing his power over the SEC there is no saying his crypto picks will go ahead.

A coin with zero utility has shot straight to Uranus and even if it drops back down to $20 Trump now has a cheap and easy argument to throw at anybody who opposed any pro crypto moved he intends to make over the next 4 years. ""You don't believe me? Well just look at how well my coin with NO UTILITY has done!"" Sounds like Classic Trump.

With that mind it could mean there's less resistance to the adoption of XRP.

Ultimately, I do think there will be a MASSIVE rug pull, but it will occur either after crypto has been adopted by FIs and governments or it will be at the end of Trump's term.

Instead of going for the highs we deviated to sweep the lows. Nevertheless,if you held good job. Its looking even better now(if we look at XRP/BTC). These are the scenarios I can see happening soon,a little patience!

XRP,2024-12-16,post,XRP,RLUSD launches globally tomorrow!,"# Raising the Standard for Stablecoins: Ripple USD Launches Globally with Unmatched Utility, Experience, and Compliance

  
Ripple, the leading provider of digital asset infrastructure for financial institutions, today announced that Ripple USD (RLUSD) will be available on global exchanges starting tomorrow, December 17, 2024. RLUSD is an enterprise-grade, [USD-denominated stablecoin](https://ripple.com/solutions/stablecoin/) created with trust, utility, and compliance at its core, backed by Ripple’s years of experience working with crypto and the existing financial system.

RLUSD will be initially available on Uphold, Bitso, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA, with additional listings on platforms such as Bullish, Bitstamp, Mercado Bitcoin, Independent Reserve, Zero Hash and others expected in the coming weeks. Each RLUSD token is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents—designed to ensure its stability, reliability, and liquidity. To maintain the highest standards of transparency, Ripple will publish monthly, third-party attestations of RLUSD’s [reserve assets](https://ripple.com/solutions/stablecoin/transparency/), conducted by an independent auditing firm.

“Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,"" said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple's CEO. ""As the U.S. moves toward clearer regulations, we expect to see greater adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD, which offer real utility and are backed by years of trust and expertise in the industry.""",801

XRP,2024-10-28,post,XRP,Stefan Thomas Revives Codius: Massive News for the XRP Ledger Ecosystem,"Stefan Thomas, former CTO of Ripple, recently announced on the Future Money podcast that he's working on a new version of **Codius.** This is a huge deal to see the return of this project, which is a decentralized, open-source hosting platform for smart contracts. 

Here’s why this matters:

**If you don't know anything about it-** Codius offers a unique approach to decentralized application (dApp) development. It supports:

* **Decentralized hosting**: Programs can run on multiple hosts, creating a peer-to-peer network for decentralized services.
* **Built-in billing**: Programs fund their operations autonomously, which enhances self-sustainability.
* **Language flexibility**: Smart contracts can be written in common languages like Java or C++, making it accessible to a wider range of developers.

**How does Codius Benefit the XRP Ledger?** The platform adds several capabilities that make it a game-changer for the XRP Ledger:

1. **Off-chain smart contract execution**: By executing contracts off-ledger, Codius reduces load on the XRP Ledger, helping maintain high transaction speeds.
2. **Cross-ledger compatibility**: It can interact with multiple blockchains, making it versatile and increasing interoperability.

**Key Features that Drive XRP Ledger Utility:**

* **Blockchain-agnostic**: Codius’s design is flexible, allowing for complex dApps and cross-chain operations without overburdening the XRP Ledger.
* **Enhanced scalability**: By offloading computation-heavy tasks, Codius allows the XRP Ledger to maintain and potentially improve its transactions per second (TPS) while supporting complex applications.

Back when it was first being worked on in 2014, Codius aimed to create a smart contract platform using hosting providers instead of traditional decentralized networks. Fun fact: Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s founder, collaborated with Stefan Thomas in early discussions, highlighting its foundational potential in the smart contract space.

Codius can bridge the gap between decentralization benefits and practical infrastructure. Its interoperability allows smart contracts to interact with other blockchains and traditional payment networks, positioning XRP Ledger as a vital intermediary in the “Internet of Value.” This may drive more transaction flow across the XRP ecosystem.

Codius could support microtransaction use cases in areas like IoT and content monetization, leveraging the XRP Ledger’s low fees. By handling smart contract logic off-chain, it could boost transaction volume, benefiting the XRP Ledger’s utility.

Codius allows developers to code contracts in secure, efficient languages, which could lead to innovative applications and attract more talent to the XRP ecosystem.

By handling smart contracts off-chain, preserving and potentially increasing XRP’s TPS, and opening up new use cases through interoperability, Codius enhances the XRP ecosystem’s potential to scale and innovate. ",51

Let's Talk About This White Paper...","**EDIT: Everyone, let's refocus on the methodology of the paper itself.** I get it, the $18,000+ price target is wild.

This may have been discussed here already, but I still want to check your thoughts.

I recently came across an old valuation white paper from June 2023, just before Judge Torres' ruling, titled 'A Comprehensive Approach To Determine The Fair Market Value Of XRP' (link:https://heyzine.com/flip-book/valuationpaperB.html#page/1).

This paper makes some bold projections, notably suggesting XRP could reach $18,036 by 2030, based on its potential to become the global cash flow value pipeline.

While the paper presents a detailed analysis, I'm curious about the community's thoughts on its realism. Given the current state of RippleNet adoption and XRP's market position, does anyone genuinely believe these projections are achievable?

Specifically, I'm wondering:

* How realistic are the adoption rates assumed in the paper?
* Are there any key factors the paper overlooks?
* What are the biggest hurdles XRP needs to overcome to achieve even a fraction of that valuation?
* How much does the legal clarity from the judge Torres' ruling affect the projections of this paper?

I'm interested in a balanced discussion, not just hype. Let's analyze the paper's assumptions and explore the possibilities and challenges ahead. Please let me know what your thoughts are.",298

XRP,2025-03-22,post,CryptoMarkets,I Tracked My Stolen XRP and Uncovered a Massive Laundering Operation. Law Enforcement Still Won’t Help.,"
I’m a U.S. combat veteran and small business owner. A week ago, 16,999 XRP was stolen from my wallet in a targeted attack. I didn’t wait for someone to save me—I spent days tracing every single transaction through the XRP Ledger, documenting exactly how my funds were laundered.

What I found was far bigger than just my theft.

I’ve uncovered a multi-layered, international laundering operation involving high-volume wallets, advanced asset obfuscation tactics, and multiple exchanges—all still active today. One of the wallets my funds passed through has moved hundreds of millions of XRP, and continues to receive funds from other suspected thefts.

I compiled everything: timestamps, wallet flows, exchange destination tags, laundering patterns. It’s all packaged into a full forensic report that any law enforcement cybercrime unit could run with immediately.

And yet—nothing.
No response from the FBI.
No follow-up from the Secret Service.
No action from state or federal law enforcement, despite multiple reports, emails, and IC3 submissions.
The only person who even called me back was my local police officer—who confirmed the wallet trail I already found.

I did the job FOR them. I tracked the stolen funds. I mapped the laundering network. I exposed a criminal system operating in plain sight on public blockchains. And law enforcement is still sitting on their hands.

This isn’t just about my 16,999 XRP anymore. This is about the fact that if I can prove this from my desk with no budget and no subpoena power—then they sure as hell can too.

I’m putting this out here because if you’ve been hit, you’re not alone. If you’ve been ignored, you’re not crazy. And if you think the system doesn’t care about cybercrime victims unless it makes headlines—well, I’m starting to believe it too.

I’m not done. I will keep pushing. And I’ll share everything I uncover until someone finally listens.",1563

No it's not possible and it's not going to happen. If XRP went to $30 it would have almost same market cap as BTC has today and be almost 5 times bigger than ETH so that's definitely not happening. I think it has potential to get to maybe $2-3 next year or maybe even a bit more, but that's probably it.

Trump has been in talks with Ripple as early as 2017 and they literally donated $5M towards his inauguration, so $60k to a lobbyist is pretty insignificant… “neither Trump, Ballard, nor Ripple employees have responded to these allegations”

If anything I feel like it’s more that Bitcoin maxis put pressure on Trump regarding Stockpiles / Reserves and to walk back some of what he has said - there is a lot of money out there and a lot of conflicting motivations and interests - Trump started pushing the narrative of ‘US made crypto” earlier in his campaign which wasn’t really a metric that was considered until now - all of which the coins he mentioned rank highly in - is Ballard just a scapegoat to appease some of others sending Trump other lobbyists and big incentives?",2

The FIT21 has a new test called the ""Decentralization Test"":

To not be a security, a token must meet certain decentralization criteria.

The token is likely a security if any of these apply:

A single company or developer controls or funds the project.

The token depends on that company’s ongoing efforts for value.

A majority of the token supply is held or controlled by insiders.

There’s no independent governance or voting by token holders.


If it fails the decentralization test, then it's a security under the law.

XRP,2025-02-21,post,CryptoMarkets,XRP Value,"This question is about potential XRP value. It is my understanding that the perceived value of XRP comes from the potential for it being used for cross-border settlements. HOWEVER,  digging into XRPs website, it seems as if the cross-border settlements will be executed on the XRP ledger, but any token can be utilized.

XRP is one of the biggest projects in crypto, with major banking partnerships and a focus on huge cross-border payments yet doesn’t have quantum security? With the rise of quantum computing, why hasn’t there been a serious push to make XRP Ledger quantum-resistant?

Other projects, like Quant, Algorand, and even CBDC initiatives, are already exploring quantum-safe cryptography. If XRP is meant to be a long-term financial solution, shouldn’t this be a priority? Or is the focus on things like regulatory clarity and adoption just a distraction from other projects?

They might be able to transition to it at some point, but the fact that other projects out there are quantum safe and “the biggest” one isn’t does seem a little odd. XRP is my biggest bag, but I actually thought of swapping some of them to Hedera and quant just to be safe",2

XRP,2025-02-24,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP Value...,"For anyone who needs a quick summary: 

The article argues that Ripple (the company) and its cryptocurrency, XRP, operate in a misleading and possibly fraudulent way. The key points are:

	1.	XRP’s Creation & Ownership – Ripple claims it didn’t create XRP, but it controls a large portion of it, giving it significant influence over the token.

	2.	Pump and Dump Allegations – Ripple allegedly increases XRP’s value artificially by promoting its use while holding a massive supply, benefiting from price increases.

	3.	Fake Customers – Ripple claims to have many financial institutions as customers, but in reality, it pays these companies to “partner” with them rather than the other way around.

	4.	Liquidity Issues – XRP is too volatile to be a reliable currency for banks, and its liquidity model doesn’t solve real-world international payment problems.

	5.	Security Classification – Ripple insists XRP isn’t a security to avoid regulation, but critics argue it meets the definition since people buy it expecting a profit.

	6.	Ineffective Technology – Some major institutions, like Santander and Western Union, tested Ripple’s payment technology but found it didn’t work better than existing systems.

	7.	Final Verdict – The article concludes that Ripple’s business model relies on inflating XRP’s value rather than delivering real innovation, making it resemble a “pump and dump” scheme rather than a legitimate financial technology company.",2

Let's say I'm holding some XRP on Binance, and the current price is $0.56 USD. Suddenly, in just a couple of days, the market goes crazy and XRP shoots up to $100 per coin.

1. To take advantage of this situation, is it enough to simply convert my XRP to USDT on Binance?
2. Is there anything else I should be aware of or do to secure my profits in this scenario?

Alt season ? There was only 2 instance of that in 2017 and 2021, and the expression ""alt season"" is extremely misleading, 99.9% of alts didnt pump or even crashed during these ""alt seasons"".  
So not only altseason is not an establish trend at all, but also, alt season doesn't mean what people, especially newcomers, think it means. On top of that, alts magnitude in crypto have been in a diminishing trend compared to bitcoin since 2017, when they were at their highest.

XRP ? Xrp has massive community of bag holders, and newcomers, its very unfortunate to get caught in the fad. The institutional adoption they are speaking of is just not happening and has been touted since 2017. In fact, if you had done some research, you'd have seen that XRP had its ATH in January 2018, and basically never ever recovered that ATH since. This is is a terrible track record, just in the charts. On top of that, there are actually too many reasons why it is a massively over estimated coin at the moment, centralized, ripple selling tokens to keep afloat, constant misinformation, XRPL being basically controlled by Ripple, a for profit company, in spite of what anyone might tell you.

Lastly, there is only one coin that has kept thriving accross all cycles, in fact cycles are literally built around it, and it is bitcoin. Anything else is a gamble, that has short lived pumps.

XRP,2024-12-16,post,CryptoMarkets,"A Comprehensive Bull Thesis on XRP for Newcomers: Research, Insights, and Discussion","Hey everyone,

I’ve spent a lot of time researching XRP and its ecosystem, and I wanted to share a comprehensive document I put together for newcomers to the space. This thesis outlines XRP’s technological strengths, market potential, regulatory progress, and more. It’s a mix of real-world data, AI-assisted analysis (via ChatGPT), and my own perspectives. My goal is to help others better understand the asset and foster constructive discussion.

# What’s Inside?

* **Core Technology:** How XRP’s consensus mechanism ensures speed, scalability, and efficiency without energy-intensive mining.
* **Use Cases Beyond Payments:** XRP’s role in tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and bridging global liquidity.
* **Market Potential:** Insights into fair market value models and the drivers behind XRP’s valuation growth.
* **Regulatory Clarity & Adoption:** Key updates, including Ripple’s legal victories and their impact on XRP’s adoption.
* **Personal Take:** While the document is grounded in research, it does reflect some of my personal bias and optimism about XRP’s future.

# Why Share This?

I’m not a professional writer—just someone passionate about research. I believe this document can serve as a helpful starting point for anyone diving into XRP and the broader crypto space. Whether you’re a beginner or seasoned investor, I hope it adds value and sparks discussion.

# How to Access the Document

You can read or download the full document \[[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLMNsvNI5fbp0YPIW6y_kYKmyYMNeD8soyjTk2QxpmA/edit?usp=sharing)\].

# Let’s Discuss!

I’d love to hear your thoughts, critiques, and additional insights. If you have any suggestions to improve the document or questions about XRP, drop them in the comments. Let’s keep the conversation respectful and educational for everyone.

Looking forward to your feedback!",1

XRP,2024-12-16,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: A Comprehensive Bull Thesis on XRP for Newcomers: ...,"You're absolutely right: XRP has positioned itself as a leader in the transition to blockchain-based financial systems that might just disrupt the traditional methods of SWIFT. The XRP Ledger provides unparalleled speed and cost efficiency, with transaction finality in 3–5 seconds and fees of less than $0.002, thus making it an ideal choice for cross-border payments​. Already, On-Demand Liquidity solutions from Ripple cut pre-funded Nostro / Vostro account dependency, freeing billions in working capital for businesses and FIs​. Additionally, the neutrality of XRP as a bridge asset connected different fragmented liquidity pools worldwide without the friction that was innate within classic systems​. Their biggest turning point, however, was a form of regulatory clarity oiled by their partial win against the SEC. The transparency brought back confidence, such that even major relistings in exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken and huge institutional adoption​ are possible today. With the green light to such stablecoins as RLUSD on the XRPL, Ripple finds itself deeper in traditional financial ecosystems​. Further, with the growing ecosystem for XRP extending its utility way beyond the realm of payments to the NFT, DeFi, and enterprise solution arenas, this diversified utility further sets a base for its growth potential in the long run. Valuation models have proved that with widespread adoption, the fair market value of XRP may see manifold increases. For example, one estimate by the ""Quantum Liquidity Model"" assumes that in scenarios where XRP becomes a dominant tool in global settlement-for instance-its value can reach $10,000-50,000 per coin.",2

XRP,2025-02-13,post,CryptoMarkets,Am I paranoid or will one of these cycles be the last for bitcoin?,"I’ve already heard people call bitcoin too big to fail which for most investments is a big red flag. 
And with quantum computing around the corner I have worries about bitcoins security, that paired with the ETF’s and investment firms, countries and banks investing in bitcoin it feels like the bubble is getting almost “too” big and I’m afraid it will pop, probably not this year yet, but maybe the cycle at the end of trumps presidency or the cycle after. 
Think about it, bitcoin isn’t much more than a giant meme coin, the price rises as long as there is hype, but for that to happen there needs to be constant flow of new holders. 
I’ve always imagined countries and investment firms to be the last to adopt crypto, and maybe they can manipulate the market for a couple of years but we have to be in the end stages of bitcoin, right?

Or please enlighten me about how there IS utility to bitcoin except that it’s worth much, just because it’s worth much. Right now it feels like a hype/meme coin and at a really high entry price ",291

XRP,2025-02-13,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Am I paranoid or will one of these cycles be the l...,"This is just the beginning.

This technology is the first time humanity has ever experienced this digital eqiuvalent of physical ownership. Technology where an item can be created with unchangable properties. Bitcoin is the first and most decentralised, rapidly rising hashrate, 50k+ nodes, cementing its unchangability and resiliance.

You can transfer wealth from A to B permissionlessly, without a corporation in the middle. That's its utility, and it will always be required, the digital equivalent of handing someone a physical coin. No bullshit no questions asked transfers. No bullshit unchangable hard-cap.

EDIT: I wanted to expand further on the 'utility' component in terms of mining. Bitcoin positioning as a world reserve currency (or atleast a major asset tracking global finance in its entirety). The need to mine creates massive demand for more efficient chip production. The need to mine creates demand for cheaper, green energy production (green energy solutions with a one-time setup cost then constant free energy are a better mining investment than forever burning renewables). Bitcoin mining furthers developments in energy and technology.

Quantum computers are still a ways away from cracking ECDSA and SHA256 (an address which has never been spent from is protected by both of these - a 'spent from' address is protected by ECDSA only). When these are cracked so is encryption of the entire internet. We will see a revolution.

Quantum computers breaking Bitcoin is not something to be feared, it's something to be excited about. The blockchain can be restored from a date prior to the incident, where there will be hard-forks with quantum resistant algorithms. There will no doubt be multiple coins proposed as the 'new Bitcoin', and there will be a battle for dominance.

Everyone who holds their own keys; their own coins will receive their wallet balance on EVERY hard-fork. Any coins held on an exchange, or if you're in the ETF, those most definitely will not.

So stack sats, self-custody your own coins. It's going to be a wild ride.",15
XRP,2025-02-13,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Am I paranoid or will one of these cycles be the l...,"Wow, I'm speechless by your position. Surely you do not understand what Bitcoin is, or what it does, or why it was conceived in 2008. I invite you to ask that question to ChatGPT, which will give you a really neat answer. The short version is that Bitcoin is the hardest form of money available, completely different from fiat money. 

It is very fitting that you call Bitcoin a memecoin, while the traditional financial system is the real meme, because money is being printed out of thin air, in staggering amounts. There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoin, so this scarcity is also what gives it it's value. For sure, something only has value because we (as a species) give something value, but in case of Bitcoin it is absolutely based on something.

The founder of Bitcoin said it best: ""If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."" But since we are a community here and you are willing to learn, I suggest you educate yourself on the financials systems and Bitcoin, and you will see more clearly where the value is coming from. Ask away if you need more info.",26

1. Tariffs all gone

2. XRP vs SEC case totally cleared - most likely in June XRP APEX in Singapore

3. ISO20022 14 July 2025

4. Full banks implementation of ISO20022 probably in Nov 2025

5. XRPL based Stable Coins adoptions goes up, e.g. RLUSD, XSGD, USDB

6. Market improved after USA recovers from supply chain issues

By end next year….other than China & its Digital Renmibi (e-RMB) there will be many other XRPL based stable coins (3-5 sec) for each country freeing up banks more foreign funds previously reserved for cross border payment under old SWIFT messaging system (3-5days)

Small amount of XRP tokens (finite supply) will be burnt permanently for each XRPL transaction 

Over time XRP can increase in prices once adoption goes higher to improve liquidity per transaction

XRP uses a fraction of the energy required per transaction (compared to Bitcoin) & there will be no more minting of XRP token 

The energy required to mint BTC token exponentially goes up over time causing wastage of energy to produce BTC instead of using on the population.

BTC slow transaction makes it harder to do point of sales payment compared to other crypto 

XRP are well suited for point of sale transactions using crypto wallet apps when banks take over custody of crypto like exchanges after OCC allowed banks to behave like exchanges 

https://www.cointribune.com/en/occ-clears-us-banks-to-buy-sell-and-custody-crypto-with-third-party-support/

|Cardano (ADA)|3|
|Polkadot (DOT)|2|
|VeChain (VET)|2|
|Stellar (XLM)|2|
|Litecoin (LTC)|1|

I score each coin 1-5 to guide how much weight I give it over 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, with a “hold-for-ever” status only for any 5-pointer. 

**Solana (5)** leads because its ultra-fast L1 and exploding DeFi scene scream long-term utility, even if the SEC keeps stalling ETF approvals for now. 

**XRP (4)** benefits from Ripple’s fresh settlement, which strips out most regulatory fog; **Hedera (4)** scores equally thanks to its governing council of multinationals, which are already shipping real-world pilots.

 **Avalanche (3)** and **Cardano (3)** have strong tech and engaged dev bases, but their ETF bids are still in limbo, so I’ll keep adding only on dips until the SEC gives clearer signals. 

**Polkadot, VeChain and Stellar (2 each)** tackle specific niches—inter-chain messaging, supply-chain tracking and cross-border payments—but need bigger user numbers before I crank up exposure. 

**Litecoin and Reserve Rights (1 each)** are pure speculative punts: they can run hard in a bull market, but lack moats and regulatory narratives, so I cap them at pocket-change size.

I’ll revisit the list every cycle, yet right now the 5-point bag is locked up for the very long haul. (DYOR, not financial advice.)

I already HODL Bitcoin and Ether as my base layer – they’re the “never sell” tickets in my FIRE plan. The scores below cover everything I’m adding on top of that core stack.",15

Brandon Biggs (""Last Days"" on YouTube) posted a video 3 months describing a vision God showed him of Trump's ear getting shot during an assassination attempt. The prophetic video has been shared across social media and major networks such as CNN. Brandon's channel views are increasing by 10's of thousands each day. A month ago, Brandon mentions a vision God showed him about the economy and the rise of XRP / Ripple. Since the video, XRP has risen over 40% and continues to climb. XRP was at $0.40 at the time of the video and is $0.61 at the time of this post. The current all time high for XRP is $3.84 though the prophet mentions $5 in some videos.

So maybe now alt season will magically begin and eth will hit 10k, link $100, etc. The real alt gainers this cycle (sol, xrp) barely passed their aths. Btc grew over the last 365 days while alts barely.

Maybe all the ""alt money"" went to etfs, btc, meme coins instead? Maybe people are getting burned out? Crypt used to be a smaller community. It's more mainstream than ever that governments are accumulating. It started with btc, went into other areas.. maybe it'll go back to mainly btc. 

  
The elites control the narrative now. Governments, billionaires. They're gonna control btc, it's supply. they'll say what's value and what isn't. And the people won't have much of a say. This cycle has been a great learning process. When I wanna screenshot my portfolio, I need to sell. When I see the elderly talk about crypto, I need to sell. When I see people in the govn and congress rug pulling, I need to sell.

The problem with this, is that TRUMP brainwashed speculators. After the XRP, pepe and bitcoin bull runs, and a big expectation towards a growth of the crypto market on the inaguration of Donald Trump, rather than seeing growth on consolidated coins, we see hype on TRUMP, a meme coin, distracting the attention of more relevant news like the SEC and FED  choices with crypto.

XRP,2025-01-29,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: TRUMP is unestabilizing the market...,"A lot of traders sold some of their cult coins or long-term coins to catch the pump on the TRUMP coin. How I see it is that a lot of liquidity was being removed from other coins and put into the TRUMP coin. This affected the market, as you can see everything was down except BTC and Solana on that day. The massive whales who’s throwing millions at the TRUMP coin pretty much liquidated a lot of the traders ports if they entered above ~$40-$60. A lot of these traders trying to catch the pump most likely resulted in a loss and putting whatever was left back where it came from. The problem with this is that these traders are going back to their original coins with less capital than they had, resulting in lower liquidity. 

For those traders who got massively wrecked probably tried to chase those losses and resulted in a blown portfolio. There for, no more capital and no more liquidity to put into their coins that they want for the long-term. 

Those whales who caught massive bags are greedy and most likely won’t go back into their cult coins or long-term coins and keep it as a stable coin or fiat. This takes away a lot of volume from crypto and less money getting distributed. 

Of course this is all speculation and my take on the view.",47

1) I’m against crypto that requires so much electricity. I just think that energy would be better served helping people, like reducing their energy bills or going towards various forms of R&D.
2) I don’t find it nearly as interesting as smart contract blockchains and their related coins.
3) with each halvening, the growth in value isn’t as impressive, and at this point I prefer looking for potential higher growth opportunities in crypto (though it is riskier).",5
XRP,2025-01-11,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Anyone not holding Bitcoin? ...,"The ideal period to hold Bitcoin is:
- At the lowest of the Bear Market until the BTC halving, for this Bull Run, BTC at the lowest of the bear was 15k and at the halving 65k, you could make a multiple of x4 like this...

Then you reinvest, at the halving in altcoins, try to aim for the top 10 cryptos and between the halving and the top of the Bull Run, you can make multiples of x3 to x4..and yes again

So I recap 
- 50k investment at the bottom of the bear in Bitcoin = 200k at the halving in Bitcoin
- 200k altcoins at halving on the top 10 = 600k at the top of the Bull Run in altcoins 
Resell everything and keep your USDC warm for the next bear and take back your 50k stake +40%, reproduce the pattern with each Bull run
50k=600k

Here is the best strategy, buy low to sell high...

But you can also buy low BITCOIN to keep it over time...

- purchase/resale

XRP,2025-03-05,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: What needs to happen at Friday’s White House Crypt...,What needs to happen for a market rally has nothing to do with Friday’s summet. At most you will get a short lived pump followed by retracement. What is needed for a sustained pump in the markets is global liquidity. That can only be delivered by the federal reserve QE. If everyone is wondering why Trump laid off federal workers and it’s bringing uncertainty to the markets with tariffs his end game is to cause a short recession forcing the federal reserve to make steep rate cuts. Once we have that markets will turnaround. Q4 2025 should be a target date for that.,217

XRP,2025-02-16,post,CryptoMarkets,Chainlink eating XRP’s lunch,"Chainlink and XRP are both going after the same market; cross border payments, large institutional transfers. 

However, they are approaching this from very different methods. I will do my best to explain both approaches and let you decide what you think is best. 


**Firstly, how does the existing system work?** 

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the biggest player in cross border payments. Facilitating **$150 trillion annually**. 

SWIFT is owned and operated by its member banks, every 3 years the organisation ownership is restructured ensuring those who use it the most, have the most control. Essentially, it’s the first DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). Its facilities transfers for about 11,000 organisations across world. 

Swift is a carrier of messages only. Not value. It will instruct banks what funds to move, not do the actual moving. 

This means banks that cover multiple countries still need to have multiple accounts holding money in the correct currency (referred to as Nostro/Vostro accounts, basically double book bookkeeping). This is obviously inefficient, large sums of money sitting around doing nothing. 

This inefficiency is a problem Crypto aims to solve. It’s a Trillion dollar problem. 



**XRP** 

XRP’s solution is the easiest to explain. 

They intend to replace Swift with XRPL. Instead of Nostro/Vostro accounts, XRP will act as a ‘Bridge currency’. Removing the need for multiple accounts. 

This has been tested by Moneygram. The test was cut short, likely due to the courtcase. I am unaware if a report of the test was ever publicly released? 



**Chainlink**

Chainlink’s solution is more tailored to the existing system. 

Chainlink has been working with SWIFT to adapt their existing system for crypto/DLT payments and usecases. 

SWIFT are working on the belief/assumption/knowledge(?) that the in the future every bank will operate its own private ledger (chain). Due to the efficiency savings a blockchain type operation will offer. Therefore SWIFT’s place in the future will be to facilitate cross chain transfers. 

To do this, Chainlink has developed CCIP (Cross chain Interoperability protocol). Using the existing SWIFT system, in the same terminal, banks can transfer crypto assets across chains. 
https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-ubs-asset-management-and-chainlink-successfully-complete-innovative-pilot-bridge-tokenized-assets-existing-payment-systems

>Chainlink’s platform orchestrated the necessary interactions between each of the respective actors to fulfil the pre-conditions for which a UBS tokenized investment fund will automatically mint or burn fund tokens for investors.

CCIP enabled the crosschain transfer, and the mint for the UBS fund. Normally a 3 step process across days, happened in seconds. 

CCIP will store a record of this transaction. What chainlink refers to as a [Unified golden record.](https://blog.chain.link/unified-golden-record/)

With this record of every cross chain transaction, whether that is across borders or not. It removes the requirement of Nostro Vostro accounts, freeing up all that cash. 



*My thoughts;* 

I think every bank will run its own chain. JP Morgan already has [Kinexy](https://www.jpmorgan.com/kinexys/index). Citi, Mastercard, Santander, Visa all use [Hyperledger]( https://dltlandscape.hyperledger.org/members) which is a private EVM chain(s) run and managed by the Linux foundation. 
[Blackrock]( https://cointelegraph.com/news/black-rock-ceo-wants-sec-to-rapidly-approve-tokenization-of-bonds-stocks-what-it-means-for-crypto)  see’s tokenisation as the future. Tokens have to live on blockchain.

SWIFT is owned by the banks already, meaning there is no conflict of interest and Chainlink can plug straight in without huge expensive changes to their existing infrastructure.  
Further cost savings can also be made using chainlink’s other products which will be key for tokenising assets going forward. 

XRP still has a usecase, but I think it will be limited to services such as moneygram. Larger organisations  wont give up control  to a separate entity (RIPPLE) or use a service which has recently had issues (random stops). 

However, I think ripple have realised this. Hence the pivot to stablecoins with smart contract functionality. Maybe a little too late? 

What do you think? 


TLDR: Read it lazy.

XRP,2025-02-16,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Chainlink eating XRP’s lunch...,"It’s important to clarify some of your misconceptions regarding XRP and Chainlink’s roles in cross border payments. 

 While Chainlink’s Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol aims to facilitate interoperability between different blockchains, it DOESN’T directly address the liquidity challenges inherent in cross border transactions. XRP, on the other hand, is designed as a bridge currency to provide on demand liquidity, reducing the need for pre funded Nostro/Vostro accounts.

Regarding the XRP Ledger’s recent outage, it’s true that the network experienced a temporary halt in block production for about an hour. This incident was due to a breakdown in communication among validators, leading to a network-wide drift. However, such occurrences are rare, and the network has mechanisms to recover without loss of assets or transactions. ￼

While some banks are exploring private blockchain solutions, the idea that every bank will operate its own chain is speculative. The financial industry is still evaluating the most efficient and secure ways to implement blockchain technology. 

 It’s also worth noting that Ripple has been actively engaging with financial institutions to promote the adoption of XRP for cross border payments.

 both XRP and Chainlink offer unique solutions for improving financial systems, but they address different aspects of the process. It’s ESSENTIAL to understand these distinctions when evaluating their roles in the evolving landscape of digital finance.

 Banks won’t all run their own private blockchains because it would be incredibly COSTLY and COMPLEX to maintain interoperability across thousands of institutions worldwide. 
 To replace Nostro/Vostro accounts entirely…EVERY bank would need direct blockchain connections with every other bank they transact with resulting in an unmanageable number of blockchains. Unmanageable. 

 A bridge asset like XRP simplifies this by enabling real time liquidity without the need for pre funded accounts or direct blockchain integrations between banks.

While Chainlink’s interoperability solutions are useful for connecting blockchains, they don’t address Bitcoin’s fundamental limitations as a payments network. 

 Bitcoin’s (which I’m sure your thread is about) slow transaction speeds, high fees during congestion, and LACK of native smart contract functionality make it impractical for large scale institutional transfers. 
 Chainlink may improve cross chain messaging…but it doesn’t solve Bitcoin’s scalability or efficiency issues in a way that makes it competitive with purpose built financial settlement networks like XRP Ledger. The world is moving to useful utilities.",40

>What do you think of QNT as the solution, picking up where Chainlink leaves off? Won't their patented API gateway and overledger platform connect to traditional finance?

I can't respond to your comment directly as /u/Hidden5g blocked me. I think I hurt his feelings with an alternative opinion. 

QNT and chainlinks CCIP fills the same niche. QNT seem to be in bed with oracle and have done trials with BIS (so have LINK). 

Problem with QNT is that it's closed source and centralised. Essentially you will be asking large businesses to trust you. Which isn't an improvement on the existing system. 

Happy to be corrected. I only looked at QNT once a year or so ago. 

Which is why I am betting on chainlink.

XRP,2025-02-16,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Chainlink eating XRP’s lunch...,Hot take. 90% of the holders of either coin could care less about the actual use of the coin and how it will be implemented. Like you said in the post I believe if there is a need to use blockchain technology in any sector especially the financial sector it will just be created by said institution to avoid the loss of profit that would occur by adopting one that already exists. Swift will create their own and not use chainlink or xrp. Xrp and chainlink will continue to grow based on the possibility of the partnership but it’s too easy to just replicate the same technology and keep all the money. I’m saying this as a massive holder of xrp (currently 90% of all my crypto and stock portfolio) I don’t think it’s going to happen I’m just riding the wave of people hoping it does.,6
XRP,2025-02-16,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Chainlink eating XRP’s lunch...,"I think a crucial point here is the transfer volume. When you use a third coin as an intermediary (e.g. XRP) you want to hold to that coin as little as possible to secure the instant FX rate. Hence, the transfer speed of the blockchain protocol is definitely an enabler. 

However, equally important is the depth of the order book. When you move large volumes either you will eat a big chunk of the liquidity or it will take a long time for the limit orders to be settled. Both cases expose the user to uncertainty in your FX spreads. This makes it a risk management problem, where banks via the use of derivatives are excellent at managing these (they become demand uncertainty aggregators).

In conclusion, for small volumes, crypto protocols are helping us, users, to save a lot on bank fees. It is already a mature and functional solution. For large volumes more liquidity is needed, which for some smaller currencies (e.g., latin american currencies) is a big barrier.",2

>“There’s unlikely to be a single prevailing blockchain network,” said Tom Zschach, Chief Innovation Officer at Swift. “We would expect to see a multitude of different platforms emerging, each serving different customer segments with their own bespoke capabilities and requirements. In such a highly fragmented ecosystem, it would simply not be feasible for financial institutions to connect to each and every platform individually. That’s why the community is working with Swift to develop an interoperability model that would enable access to different platforms globally.” 

>Instead of building new infrastructure and technology stacks entirely from scratch, financial institutions want to leverage their existing infrastructure to connect to blockchain ledgers, where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure. Not only would this help firms simplify their architecture and operations, but it also minimises investment costs and reduces risk of technology obsolescence.


In the same year (2023), using CCIP enhanced SWIFT system, ANZ (Largest bank in AUS, 1trillion assests under management) successfully demonstrated how ANZ customers could use CCIP to securely transfer ANZ-issued stablecoins cross-chain to purchase nature-based assets. This happened in one transaction across 2 chains. One public chain (AVA) and a permissioned private chain. 

Anurag Soin, director of digital asset services at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd explains it all here (5mins long, definitely worth watching);

This brings us to more recent developments with SWIFT in 2024; 
https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-ubs-asset-management-and-chainlink-successfully-complete-innovative-pilot-bridge-tokenized-assets-existing-payment-systems

More of what we already know, but done at scale across multiple different banks, all utilising existing SWIFT infrastructure with CCIP to settle subscriptions and settlements of tokenised funds. 

>Chainlink platform and the Swift network to settle subscriptions and redemptions for tokenized investment fund vehicles, thereby allowing the straight-through-processing of the payment leg without the need for the global adoption of an on-chain form of payment. This helps in the automation of the entire lifecycle of the fund redemption and subscription process.

>“For digital assets to be adopted globally, they must seamlessly integrate with both existing payment systems and digital currencies,"" said Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Strategy, Swift. 


I have established that Chainlink and SWIFT have been working and building together for 8 years. 

Their aim was to build upon the existing SWIFT network, improving it with Chainlink's CCIP, to allow banks to access blockchains/DLT services. 

They have succeeded. Chainlink's CCIP is a Swift designed product. 

What does this mean for blockchains/DLT? 

Banks do not need to change existing systems or work methods. They just use CCIP. 

Banks do not to integrate individually with each blockchain. They just use CCIP. 

Banks do not need to hold 100's of different blockchain gas tokens. They just use CCIP. 

SWIFT won't connect to any blockchains. SWIFT will connect to Chainlink. 

Chainlink will connect to everything.

XRP,2025-05-20,post,CryptoMarkets,XRP ain’t mooning unless it turns into a government tool here’s the real reason no one talks about,"XRP ain’t getting adopted globally unless it turns into a CBDC. Yk why i said that? This is the kinda shit they dont talk openly about on youtube, X and manu other social media platforms. So FOR XRP to go to the moon first off it needs to be adopted entirely into global financial systems, why? Becuz government would never adopt the transactions of the currencies they cannot control. Yes. For xrp to become a global currenc, IT NEEDS RIPPLE TO BEND OVER AND GIVE FULL ACCESS to the government. That’s the only way governments are gonna back it, don’t matter if it’s public, private, legal, or shady. If they can’t track it 24/7, they’re not touching it. Will XRP actually become a CBD? I don’t think so. Govern would make their own from the scratch.

XRP was made to be used, not held. It’s not built for hype like BTC, and it doesnt have the ecosystems like SOL no smart contracts, no NFTs, no DeFi scene. It’s a money mover. That’s it.

So if you think the price is gonna go up just because people are buying it, you’re lying to yourself. XRP only moves if the global financial system starts running on it. And for that to happen, Ripple’s gotta hand the keys to the same system crypto was built to break away from.

Basically, for XRP to moon, it needs to stop being crypto and start being a tool for the system.

I started out mining and with a small amount, read loads, applied what I learned in business and started building a portfolio.

I’ve done far better than my managed portfolio that was equal at the beginning of this experiment.

XRP,2025-06-07,post,CryptoMarkets,"Surely the only play is alts, catch the pump, sell before dump.","Hear me out. I think HODL is just for Bitcoin. Wait several years, keep DCAing, don't even check the price. Store of wealth and all that.

For those of us wanting to trade, I think alts are just oscillators. They have a base trend and very rarely (once per cycle, maybe even once per year) have a huge pump like this:

\- massive pump

\- decays away slowly

\- sometimes secondary pumps

\- but eventually reversion to the base trend.

Sometimes the base trend is slightly up (never good enough to HODL though), sometimes it's flat, sometimes it's down! But great long term appreciation, these aren't stocks!

Here are some opportunities:

**XRP**

Big pump every 3/4 years. It's slow rising long term but I would never hodl it instead of bitcoin. Today it's way too high, I don't believe it's established a new baseline, I don't care how close they are to the US government. It's heading back sub 1 again, just a matter of time. A terrible buy today. If you hold it today, just sell it. Literally no point owning it right now.

**ETH**

I think this is a long term slow grower, again with huge pumps every few years. Honestly, I think it's still a good buy. In fact, the recent pump signalled that there is still pump potential in ETH. Some alts pump twice and never pump again, I think ETH demonstrated it will still pump from time to time. It's such a high market cap that it's pumps aren't as violent as other coins but the pumps and the decaying dumps do take quite a while so timing is not difficult.

**SOL**

Looks way over-priced. Remember, these are not stocks. There are no discounted cash flows behind the scenes building up asset price like stocks. Alts can grow baseline over years but not hugely. I think SOL will eventually go back to sub-50. Terrible buy right now, you have no idea if it will pump big and beat ATH anytime in the next year or two, or dump to 50 first. Sell it now if you own it.

**DOGE**

I think this is a good buy again if you are willing to be patient and wait for the pump. When it pumps, it will double or even triple in price. How low could it go before then? It's 0.18 today, I can't see it going sub 0.10 and when it pumps it could go pretty high.

**LINK**

Almost at lows again, not a bad price, reminds me of DOGE.

**BCH**

Pumps are getting less each time but I still think it will pump higher if you bought today

**LTC**

This is overdue a huge pump I think. Even if it's dead and nothing happens, I don't think hard to exit break-even.

**DOT**

This is a bargain, I just wish it was easier to buy from DEX/swap services. Even if it only pumps to 10 again, that's more than 2x.

  
To reiterate, I think the only trading game is to try and buy at value prices, don't overpay. Wait for the pump, obviously try to time the top but even if you sell early you can make 2x easily and possibly more. Way better than BTC. I have BTC but I'm starting to think it's a waste of time, the risks don't justify the rewards. Whereas alts bought at low prices are very low risk.

XRP,2025-06-07,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Surely the only play is alts, catch the pump, sell...","You need to look at BTC.D , ETH/BTC Ratio, compare the supply&marketcap from past and today on alts and also the price it was in the begin of the bullmarket to now.

eg.

BTC in Jan 2023: 16650$,

BTC in 2025 ATH: 110k $

\+660% raise.

  
Doge in 2023 at lowest: 0.05$

Doge ATH since: 0.47$

\+940%

  
That's are just 2 random examples.

Next I take for example LINK the comparisson between 6 June 2021 from snapshot in coinmarketcap and present.

2021:

Price: 27.55$

Marketcap: 11'874'992'855.91$

Circulating Supply: 431'009'554 LINK

  
Today:

Price: 14$

Marketcap: 9.22B

Circulating Supply: 657'099'970.45 Link (+52.45% more than in 2021).

  
Which means that if LINK have same marketcap as 2021, the value will not be 27$ but 18$, this due to the diluation of the new coins in circulation.

Marketcap 2021 / Circulating Supply Today = Price.

  
But all of these are also influenced by the value of the $, DXY.

If the dollar goes down, it's normal to see prices going up, it's just the devaluation of the $ but it's not a real gain.

  
There are so much data that people just don't look after but only dream of infinite pumps, like XRP at 100$ which it will be never a reality and these people are just delusional.",8

Since that moment, LTC has grown from 60 USD to 110 USD. While BTC has grown from 6000 USD to 107 000 USD. This is just one example out of too many.

As the value of FIAT (traditional currency) goes down, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are getting more valuable. It’ll make you money faster than any high yield savings account you can find on the market. 

Crypto is now a 3.5 trillion dollar market. It should become a 10 trillion dollar market in the next 5 years or so. When bitcoin is the front runner of that market, it means that bitcoin will upwards of around 1 million each when that happens. And it’s only going to go up even more in the next 30 years. 

Bitcoin is the only currency that the government can’t touch. It’s all held on the blockchain and you have the key to your safe within the blockchain. Everything on the blockchain has a trail. There’s no moving things around unnoticed. 

If your bank goes out of business the government only insures a portion of your money. Usually around $150k. So if they go out of business or go bankrupt anything over that you have within their system they’re not liable for.

Holding most of your assets in bitcoin is going to be huge in the long run. It’s still not too late. Bitcoin is still cheap compared to what it’ll be worth in 5-10-20 years. It’s only going up.

You’ll see volatile moments where the price dips quite a bit but it always comes back to reach new highs. You can see that for yourself if you look at the max time frame chart.

We’re coming to the end of the era of people who didn’t grow up with computers. Millenials are in their 40s now and the first to understand technology.

Pi Cycle hasn’t flashed. CBBI is still well below euphoric territory. BTC dominance hasn’t dropped , in fact, it has stayed elevated or even increased, which is unusual for a fullblown bull cycle. Typically, we see BTC dominance crash as capital flows into altcoins during the mania phase. That hasn’t happened yet.

And yet... macro is turning ugly. No sign of Fed rate cuts. Recession risks are rising in the US. Liquidity is tightening. It feels like either  

(a) the best is yet to come, and this was just a midcycle pause before the real mania  
(b) this was a stealth top and the cycle ends prematurely due to macro headwinds  
(c) the bull cycle timeline has shifted entirely,  maybe delayed by a year, which would be highly unusual compared to previous halvingdriven patterns

Another strange thing is that global M2 money supply has already peaked. stocks are also down. Where is all the money going?

What’s your take? Are we on the brink of something big, or are we headed for a letdown?",15

XRP,2025-06-13,post,CryptoMarkets,Ethereum,"I was fully ready to sell all my Ethereum on June 11th after watching it climb a solid amount—finally felt like the right moment to lock in some real profit. But then, like a fool, I let Reddit influence me. Some random user claimed June 12th was going to bring a “major announcement” that would change the future of Ethereum forever. Said it was going to pump hard and that we were on the edge of something huge. Against my better judgment, I held.

Well, June 12th came and went, and that so-called “big announcement” was a whole lot of nothing. Instead of mooning, Ethereum just kind of hovered—or worse, dipped. To add insult to injury, there were other factors dragging the market down, like the Iran strikes and Gaming Link dumping shares, which just compounded the disappointment. It’s honestly wild how fast sentiment can flip and how easily people get caught up in hype.

XRP,2025-01-05,post,CryptoMarkets,Read before considering XRP - Just some thoughts ,"I had a few posts joking around earlier but want to provide some serious and important information to anyone considering XRP and what to expect.  No, my comments below are not jokes.. just a head up.

1. XRP is tantamount to a scam and here is exactly why you should be weary:

* From a trading perspective chart looks good.. 7 year consolidation so those that made money.. way to be patient and genuinely bravo, I myself was a holder.
* XRP has 100 validators and only 25 are active 7 of them are actually Ripple - in terms of validators... don't even get me started.  If you know about validators you know its not a great situation here lol.
* In terms of token distribution... estimates show Ripples ownership is around 48 billion XRP (nearly 50% ish), which represents a large percentage of the circulating supply... Of the circulating supply..other entities like early founders also own a substantial amount of XRP.  Of the remaining not in circulation, you guessed it owned by Ripple.  This means that if the Ripple team/XRP team/or original founders want to rug pull (hmmm that hasn't been happening? lol) they can at any moment... and vice versa..
* When I see that Ripple owns (or any similar) owns 50% + of the supply as well as the supply reserve to boot.. be weary.. it seems pretty shady.
* Technology - in 7 years of existence they have no smart contracts.. Sure you might say the banks and institutions and so on and so forth.. neither here nor there.. speculation at best.
* This doesnt mean it won't go higher from here but looking at everything.. just consider all angles and don't fall for someone saying its going to hit $100 the day Trump takes office.  $5 may be possible.. and in my opinion that could be followed swiftly by a rug pull.
* Conclusion: of the crypto to consider... XRP has no smart contracts, poor token distribution, majority owned by Ripple and founders, rug pull could happen at any moment if they want, most of the movement of late is based on pure speculation and the bitcoin cycle (i.e. just bitcoin whales rotating around..XRP had its day and I'm genuinely pumped if you were there for it).
* Unfortunately many of you won't see this because I'm sure it will get removed for being honest.  If you do read it, make sure you do your diligence.. don't just believe this post... but for goodness sakes.. please don't listen to the youtube armies and absurd posts about unrealistic price targets.. they are fun and exciting and meaningless.  Truth is in the pudding.  Hope I'm wrong and genuinely don't mean anything negative towards the token or those supporting it, I've held it, enjoyed the run, and now it's just getting a little out of hand with all the ""HITTING 60K by THIS YEAR"" nonsense.. its very misleading.

Stay strong XRP/Ripple Fam - I genuinely genuinely hope XRP has a great future and rockets to $100.",100

But here’s the thing—I don’t understand it. Unless someone can break it down in layman’s terms (simple enough for a complete newbie), does XRP’s utility even matter? If I can’t grasp what makes it special, can its so-called ""utility"" really hold any value?

This brings me to my second question:

In a crypto world where prices are dictated by market demand, how is Ripple (XRP) fundamentally more valuable than something like a meme coin (e.g., PEPE)? Let’s break it down:

Both XRP and PEPE seem top-heavy, meaning whales can heavily influence the market.

From the public’s perspective, they’re essentially just charts to follow and trade on.

So, what truly separates XRP from a ""shitcoin"" like PEPE? Is it just the hype, or is there a tangible, undeniable reason why XRP should hold more value?

I’m genuinely curious and open to learning, but I need it explained simply and clearly. No buzzwords, no hype—just the facts. Thanks in advance!

>If I can’t grasp what makes it special, can its so-called ""utility"" really hold any value?

Yes, your ability or inability to understand something does not contribute to it's value in any sort of way.

I'm not the best at explaining to something to a 5 year old but maybe I can help.

XRP is made by Ripple.  Ripple created their ledger system, XRPL and their patented On Demand Liquidity(ODL) system with XRP in mind.  XRPL can and does handle other currencies.  Ripple's goal is to distrupt and replace the current bank to bank and cross border transfer system.  The current system is SWIFT as well as a nosotros/vosotros system.  The problems with these systems is that they are very slow, very expensive and require the banks to carry a large amount of money on hand since, in a lot of ways, it's a really complicated IOU system.  With the current system you want to transfer money from the Mexico to Japan that means either Mexico has to have the Yen on hand for conversion or JPY needs to have mexican currency(sorry, i forget the abbreviation.  Been out of forex too long) on hand.  If this is not possible it needs to go through a chain of intermediaries until you can get to a compatible currency pair.  This is why it can take 5 days and a lot of fees.  Like... millions.

So, here is our XRP/XRPL system.  I'll just bullet point the advantages over the traditional system:

* It eliminates the need of tying up a large amount of capital in various currencies just so you can handle conversions.  You simply need XRP(or some other currency) as a bridge.  XRP is ideal for that bridge.  Banks don't even need to have XRP on hand at the time of the transfer.
* It's fast.  2-5 second settlement time.  The current system takes 1-5 days.
* Cheap.  Something like 0.00001 XRP so, realistically, always less then a USD penny.  With conversion fees SWIFT can be 1-5% as well as some other fees.
* While XRPL can use various crypto currencies, XRP is the ideal bridge currency.  Their ODL system only uses XRP.  Since we are looking at transfers that might be billions of USD in value their ODL system is going to be utilized quite a bit.

So, while you might not value the utility you can perhaps see why large financial institutions will value it.  A lot of the reasons why some crypto bros here hate it is actually the reasons why large financial institutions will find it attractive.

Now, there are some other coins/blockchains that can handle most of these functions now but it's silly to dismiss XRP as a 'shitcoin'.",48

XRP,2024-12-16,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Can someone explain xrp to. Me like I'm 5?...,"Great questions, and let me break it down as simple as possible.

**1. What's special about XRP?**

XRP was created to solve a real problem: the movement of money around the world. Traditional systems are slow, taking up to days to settle, and expensive. XRP has the potential to enable banks and businesses to send money in 3–5 seconds for under $0.002 in fees, saving billions by removing the need for pre-funded accounts​. Ripple's partnerships with banks and businesses prove real-world use​.

**2. How does XRP differ from a meme coin like PEPE?**

|**Feature**|**XRP**|**PEPE**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Purpose**|Solves global payment problems.|Purely speculative fun.|
|**Use Case**|Used by banks/businesses.|No real-world application.|
|**Demand**|Driven by utility.|Driven by hype.|

While meme coins are based on speculation, XRP creates long-term demand by being useful in global finance.

**3. Does utility matter?**

Yes! Meme coins fade when hype dies, but with more banks and businesses using XRP, its value grows. Utility is what sets XRP apart; it's solving real problems, not riding trends.",3

XRP,2025-05-24,post,CryptoMarkets,Neeed advice ASAP any response is a good response,"
Hey everyone, first post here—appreciate any advice you’ve got.

I’m 18 and started getting into crypto properly around November 2024. I’m not working at the moment since I’ve got A-levels coming up, so I’m just doing this on the side with some money I’ve saved up. At the peak on January 19th, my portfolio was at £722.82, but now it’s at £411.69, and I’m trying to understand what I’m doing right and what I’m doing wrong.

I used to hold XRP—bought at £0.52 and sold at £2.48 each. I withdrew the profit thinking I’d won the lottery, and yeah, worst decision. I’ve been trying to build my portfolio again since. I had 122.38 coins all positions closed wish i didnt.

Here’s what I currently hold 

Hedera (HBAR) – 1,791.41 HBAR (£252.27)

Polkadot (DOT) – 22.29 DOT (£75.90) (100% staked)

Bitcoin (BTC) – 0.000667 BTC (£53.37)

Chainlink (LINK) – 2.13 LINK (£24.72)

Ondo (ONDO) – 7.69 ONDO (£5.38)


Why I’m invested in these:

Hedera – I genuinely believe in the technology and long-term potential of the network. It’s not a hype coin in my eyes. The hashgraph consensus system is unique, and the transaction speeds and fees are consistently solid. There’s speculation that BlackRock may adopt HBAR through an ETF, and although I know not to bank everything on speculation, I’m trying to build a stronger position in it because I think it has real potential for mass adoption.

Polkadot – I know it’s fallen off in popularity, but I still believe in the project. It’s actually being used in the UAE for payments and infrastructure, which gives it real-world utility. I like that it focuses on interoperability—connecting blockchains instead of isolating them—and I’ve staked 100% of my DOT to try and grow the holding a little more passively.

Bitcoin – Holding a bit just for that long-term safety net, though I can’t afford much right now.

Chainlink and Ondo – Smaller positions, just trying to diversify slightly. LINK has decent fundamentals and real-world use, while ONDO I’m just watching to see how it performs.



---

Some things I’m struggling with:

I was actually doing well until the dip after the Trump tariffs, and now I’m feeling a bit lost. I’ve learned not to panic sell (even if I’m deep in the red) and I always try to DCA down when I can—but it’s hard when you’re unsure if your picks are good long term.


---

A bit of how I invest:

I don’t follow hype blindly. I try to look into the actual technology and adoption before buying. I’m not perfect at it, but I’ve spent hours watching videos, reading whitepapers, and checking use cases. I know I still have a lot to learn though.

Would really appreciate feedback—whether it's on portfolio structure, timing, or understanding spreads/fees better. Be honest. I want to get better at this without falling into bad habits early.

Thanks again if you made it this far.

XRP,2025-05-04,post,CryptoMarkets,The Illusion of Trust: Why Tether (USDT) Is Still a Ticking Time Bomb,"Back in 2021, I made a simple analysis of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin in crypto. My conclusion was clear: the entire system runs on trust, not transparency. Now, in 2025, shockingly little has changed. It's time to restate the obvious — maybe for the last time before things actually break.

Red flags (that everyone keeps ignoring)

Still no audit. Not a single full, independent audit of their reserves. Just some ""assurance reports"" from mid-tier firms.

They can mint billions of USDT out of thin air. And no one truly checks if real fiat backs it. Just trust them.

80 people manage over $100 billion. Seriously. That’s the entire Tether team. Smaller than a medium-sized company.

USDT is embedded in everything. From Binance to obscure DeFi protocols — if Tether collapses, a big chunk of the ecosystem goes with it.


Why it's still running

As long as people believe, it works. Just like fiat money — but without a central bank as backstop.

No one wants to break the illusion. Exchanges, funds, traders — they all benefit from keeping the game going.

No serious enforcement. US regulators have taken small bites, but never gone all in.


But... how much longer?

Over a 10-year horizon, I’d say there’s a solid 30%+ chance that Tether either collapses or is overtaken by more transparent competitors. And when it does happen, people will act surprised — even though the signs were there all along.

My 2021 conclusion still stands:

Tether is not a stable foundation. It's a fragile experiment in collective trust that works only as long as no one dares to say the emperor has no clothes.

Do you believe Tether will still be standing 5–10 years from now? Or have you been side-eyeing this thing since 2021 too?",40

Anyway, you're confusing an audit with an attestation. The latter attests that the capital is there.

An audit would look at the sources of that capital. Tether probably has dirty money in its past. Hence the refusal of an audit.

XRP,2025-01-06,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: I want to invest around 10k in BTC....,"Use this strategy: put $1000 now and hold it for two weeks. If it goes red in that time, double down and put 2000 more. If after another two weeks to one month, it goes red again, double down on your previous bet and put another 4K. 

However, if it goes green after a couple of weeks of 1K, put another 1K and repeat until it goes red, when you use the above strategy instead. Once your 10k is invested, don’t think about it for 5 to 10 years, if that’s possible for you. 

During that period, if you manage to attain more funds that you are willing to invest, dollar cost average your BTC holdings.

Nobody wants to use XRP. They want to use Ripple Labs' software for remittances, but *nobody* wants to use the XRP ledger. Why? Ask the banks that *Ripple Labs paid millions* to pilot XRP and all of them said it's vastly more expensive than just using Ripple's software without XRP.  Almost all of those ""partnerships"" were paid for by Ripple Labs to pilot them and almost all of them came back and said ""software is good, XRP is not."" And no, buying XRP is **not like buying stock in Ripple Labs.**

Ripple knows this. That's why they literally dump XRP on their own holders in order to invest in their software's development and pretty much ignore development for the XRP ledger entirely. Jed McCaleb, XRP and Ripple founder, clearly saw this happening and sold everything in 2022.

XRP,2025-02-05,post,CryptoMarkets,"Reddit users, You Don't Need to Be Negative! Bullish Market Ahead - Which Coins Do You Think Have the Most Potential?","Hey reddits users,

I wanted to take a moment to share some thoughts on the current market sentiment because I’ve been seeing a lot of negativity floating around lately. Yes, the crypto market can sometimes feel like a rollercoaster ride, but I genuinely believe that if you’re holding good projects, there’s no need to panic or foster negativity. In fact, I see some signs that suggest we could be heading towards a bullish market in the next months!

# Why Optimism is Key

First off, let’s remember that markets go through cycles. The crypto world is famous for its volatility—prices can swing dramatically in a very short period. However, if you’re invested in solid projects with strong fundamentals, you have every reason to stay optimistic. Historically, after smaller dips, we have seen recoveries that not only make up for lost time but often see prices surging beyond previous all-time highs.

# Potential Growth Ahead

So, I want to turn the conversation to you all. Which coins do you believe have the most potential in the upcoming altseason? Are there any under-the-radar projects that you think could surprise us? Let’s share our insights and keep the vibes positive!

Here are my top coins (most of them are known):

1. **Ethereum (ETH)** \- As we await major upgrades and developments in the DeFi and NFT space, Ethereum continues to remain a solid long-term investment.
2. **Solana (SOL)** \- Known for its high throughput and low fees, Solana has become a favorite in the DeFi and NFT worlds.
3. **Ripple (XRP)** \- With a focus on revolutionizing traditional finance and cross-border payments, XRP could see significant gains if regulatory uncertainties are resolved positively.
4. **Movement (MOVE)** \- As a community focused player in the crypto space, Move's focus on interoperability and innovative solutions could position it for substantial growth as the market expands. This one is the coin for me with the most potential, because Mainnet launch will be in the next weeks!
5. **Chainlink (LINK)** \- As more projects integrate oracles into their systems, Chainlink is becoming        increasingly crucial and could see a significant uptick.

I’m excited to hear your thoughts! What projects are you bullish on? Let’s keep this community positive and engaged as we navigate what could be an exciting time ahead.",22

XRP,2025-02-05,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Reddit users, You Don't Need to Be Negative! Bulli...","Love the positivity, especially with so much doom and gloom going around! I’m fully with you on ETH, every time I think it’s peaked, some new DeFi/NFT update or layer-2 solution pops up and revives the hype. SOL is still a beast when it comes to speed and fees, so I’m sticking with that for the long run. XRP might moon if the regulatory clouds clear, so hey, could be a dark horse.

I haven’t heard too much about Movement (MOVE) until now, but I’m definitely intrigued by any project focusing on interoperability, cross-chain compatibility is basically the future if we want actual adoption. Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) is one I keep an eye on, because oracles are basically the unsung heroes of Web3.

As for under-the-radar, I’m watching Ocean Protocol, it’s about data marketplaces and tokenizing data, which could get huge if AI becomes the next big wave (kinda already is, right?). Always do your own research, but if 2023–2024 leans even harder into AI stuff, data infrastructure could see a big spotlight.",5

XRP,2025-05-06,post,CryptoMarkets,Is XRP a meme coin? - The Ultimate Showdown,"*There appears to be some sort of botnet that mass downvotes those critical of  XRP, so please upvote helpful responses. Downvote those spreading unverifiable fan fiction.*

I am going to explain why I think XRP is a memecoin. XRP fans, please respond **with evidence** why i am wrong. 

1. XRP's value is not derived from its purpose as the gas token on XRPL. Using data from [here](https://xrpscan.com/metrics) roughly 3k XRP is spent as fees daily. So roughly 6k USD is spent daily. 
Which does not justify its billions in marketcap. Its 'ODL' (another meme within a meme) was [declared by ripple as demand neutral](https://imgur.com/a/W4ynYQV). Quickly bought and sold so does not cause price fluctuations. 

2. Institutional users of the XRP token. We have all heard this before. But we can not see it. Please prove these users exists via usage on-chain. I will accept a degree of assumption here. [Here is blackrocks wallet on eth](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/blackrock)

3. Ripples stable coin; RLUSD. Launched to a lot of fanfare, mainly onto the Ethereum chain. [Evidence of RLUSD circulation by chain](https://defillama.com/stablecoin/ripple-usd). How can XRP be the payment rails of the world, if they are doing the majority of the settlement on eth? 

4. Using retail funds to buy already successful businesses to enrich their shareholders. Nearly 100% of Ripples income comes from XRP token sales. [Evidence](https://imgur.com/a/BSGvpZR). They then use this money to buy businesses such as Hidden Road, with no method of value accrual to the XRP token. The profits of those businesses go to excu team/shareholders, while XRP retail buys pick up the tab. 


XRP fans, please can you explain why I am wrong with evidence?",33

XRP,2025-05-07,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Is XRP a meme coin? - The Ultimate Showdown...,"All of crypto is speculative : ripple has been around over 10 years making XRP more useful and has been acquiring companies adding utility : hidden road + metaco… they have so many connections across tradfi, and there is a ton of real world utility there… it can achieve so many of the things Bitcoin set out to do but can’t… 

You seem to have some lack of understanding around the gas fees on XRP as well : the fee is burnt - it does not go to ripple, or back into the supply, it is gone… SOL gives 1/2 of the burn to their validators as a reward, but that is not how XRP works and burn fee has nothing to do with market cap - market cap is just price x supply 

There is a lot of misinformation around transactions - some spread hopium that if there are trillions tokenized or moved that means market cap goes up to trillions… but this is a lie : as you stated (and ripple) the supply / demand stays around the same; and any price discrepancy is arbitraged away…  (also misinformation around ISO 20022 coins, tokenization, and the escrow mechanics) - there are just as much false FUD misinformation as well- there are a lot of people who just hate XRP because reasons as well and have more of a bias against it just because (I find most XRP holders have a very diversified folio and like picking up new crypto projects but are happy to debate maxis who only hold 1 project etc)

In an institutional level there is evidence of larger holders acquiring more while retail sells - 
They have 10 years+ of networking and have an impressive list of corporate partners and their 1700 NDAs, not to mention they have been acquiring banking and money transfer licenses across the world (one criticism original crypto investors had of XRP was that it was ‘the bankers coin’ but these days a lot of people want that government and institutional money, and new investors prefer things to be safer and more like tradfi (while original adopters were very anti-gov anti- establishment etc) 

Performance wise XRP often moves more volume on some exchanges than BTC / ETH…

RLUSD is just another addition to the ecosystem (runs using XRP) : yes runs on ETH as well but that’s a good thing for ripple … most XRP holders hold multiple coins and believe in a multichain future with many crypto projects achieving different purposes and meeting different needs - there is a HUGE difference between layer one chains actively developing real world utility vs a meme pump and dump fueled on hype and effectively just a casino : SOL is not a meme but how many of the projects constantly launching on it are? XRP / ETH / other chains can run memes as well but it’s much more prevalent on SOL   

It’s worth noting from this point a year ago XRP is up 282% (top performing crypto in the top 100) , while ETH is down 43.2%   : over the last year only a handful of projects are in the green : XRP 282.5% BGB 260.6% SUI 188.8% WBT 167.5% GT 149.7% TKX 137.1% XLM 128.5% XMR 112% _FTN 108.2% TRX 91.1% AAVE 85.3% HBAR 51.6% BTC 45.4% ADA 44% LEO 43.4% TON 34.5% LTC 6.5% DOGE 6.4% ONDO 2.1%",2

XRP,2025-01-15,post,CryptoMarkets,How Do You See the Bitcoin Movement After Trump Assumes Office?,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about how Bitcoin might react as President-elect Trump takes office. It’s trading around $97,000 right now, and analysts like Lark Davis are pointing out some interesting similarities to its behavior during the last election cycle. He’s highlighted three distinct phases Bitcoin went through back then, and with Trump’s pro-crypto stance, it feels like history could “rhyme” again.  
  
What really grabs my attention is Trump’s plan to reshape crypto regulations and even build a national Bitcoin reserve to tackle the $36 trillion debt. It’s a bold move that could bring more confidence to the market, something we didn’t see with the previous administration.  
  
On the technical side, Doctor Profit is optimistic too, saying Bitcoin needs to hold above $95,900 and break $97,500 to keep its momentum. With BTC already up 3% in the last 24 hours, the $100,000 mark doesn’t feel so far off anymore.  
  
I can’t help but wonder if this is Bitcoin’s moment to shine. What’s your take? could this political shift push BTC to new heights?",6

Longer term not so good because Trump has been very clear about his goal of reducing the number of dollars being spent/held in the global economy - and less money means less to spend on BTC. <- Yes this statement is reductive and subject to executive reconsideration, but reflects the broad strokes of current stated policy. 

In the very long term BTC will likely rise, because that's what it has historically done, regardless of politics. 

But if you prefer to be political about it, BTC may see long term growth from the perceived erosion of public trust in institutions such as the federal reserve.",3

Could be some surprise announcement that makes things bounce 20%-50%, or we could see a continued downtrend.  I have some long positions that are getting slaughtered, but I'm also sitting on the sidelines with a little bit of cash.  There's a lot going on globally right now. As I said before, those in the US who were single issue voters and ignored a helluva lot of red flags are learning a tough lesson and we're all along for the ride.  

IMO, long term catalysts will be: 

1. Clearer US regulations from both Congress and the SEC and/or CFTC so that retail and investors will feel more comfortable in the sector. Meme rug pulls aren't helping to shake off the scam criticisms of the sector BTW.  Crypto enthusiasts loved them because they were ""fun"" and making people money overnight, but from the outside it wasn't a good look. No, the US President launching his own meme before the inauguration didn't help either.
2. Better global economic stability.  US is likely headed towards a recession or even a depression depending on how things are handled.  That will also drag down the global economy.

Bitcoin will probably head into the teens over the next 6 months or year. Crypto is not like investing in a company- you only generate value by dumping it on someone else so that they lose, not you. It’s sucker bait for people that rely on it, unless you have the wealth and prescience hold out or accurately forecast shifts in the market for crypto currency, you’re the sucker that made someone else rich. The best way to make money is to get a job as an electrician or a plumber or hvac technician that generates value in the world and society, and if you have extra money, invest in private enterprise that generates value in society.

This has not really happened yet.

I’m obviously not an expert nor am I here to say this is gospel but it seems one or both of these two conditions must be met if there is going to be a bull run that equals or exceeds those in the past.

That said, here’s my opinion, which could be totally wrong, like everyone else’s.

I dumped POL a long time ago. I think it had so much strong, innovative competition in the L2 space. I hold no bags, but STARK seems like the strongest direct competitor in that space.

Similarly with DOT & AVAX. Great tech, but are likely to get out performed by the likes of SUI because it’s fresh, addressing issues with congestion, expansion, fees and onboarding. I may come back to them next cycle, but my POL bag went into HBAR long ago, and my AVAX recently went to SUI & ALGO.

My QNT bag went into BTC end of ‘22 and I’ve never regretted it. Maybe they’re doing great things now. But I’ve paid no attention.

Otherwise, the rest of your are the same as my portfolio, except that I dumped my SOL into HBAR & ALGO recently while SOL was still up. I may buy back in over the coming months, figuring that the big unlocks will keep the price depressed. I could be wrong though. Either way, I feel HBAR and ALGO will outperform SOL this year. 

Fingers crossed there are some big spikes coming. Good luck!",5

Since the SEC dropped nearly all charges against Ripple and settled for a much lower amount than originally demanded, I believe there's no longer any room for the SEC to claim that XRP should be classified as a security instead of a cryptocurrency.

Historically, the SEC has made some questionable moves, like the acceptance of the Madoff scandal, and while I agree that the SEC’s actions have often been questionable, I don't see them filing another lawsuit against Ripple anytime soon. Under the current U.S. presidency, which is more crypto-friendly, I don't expect any major legal issues for Ripple in the near future.

U.S. Crypto-Friendly Policy:

With Trump, the U.S. had a president who was a strong believer in cryptocurrency. While I’m not entirely sure, it seems that under Trump, XRP was even considered for use as a crypto reserve asset, similar to gold? (Again, I’m not from the U.S., so I’m not 100% certain here.)

Additionally, U.S. policy has helped attract international investment into crypto, particularly XRP. For example, the Saudi Arabian energy company, owned by the Saudi Prince, invested $121 million in XRP.

Ripple’s Strategy:

Now we get into some details. Ripple has capped the total supply of XRP at 100 billion coins, with around 59 billion currently in circulation. As transactions occur, a small number of XRP coins are burned (currently around 0.0007 XRP per transaction, if I recall correctly).

Imagine this scenario: Cryptocurrency is still relatively new, and not everyone fully understands the technology behind it. As more people become aware of the potential of blockchain, more XRP coins will be burned with each transaction. This could result in a significant reduction in supply over the next 5-15 years.

Ripple designed XRP to facilitate cheap, fast payments between banks and financial institutions. Many of these institutions already acknowledge XRP as a viable payment tool, and this is why Ripple has partnered with several major banks and financial institutions.

The Greed Factor:

I've seen it happen over and over again: Many people invest in things without truly understanding them, simply because there’s a hype around it. They hear about others making insane profits from a few speculations and think, “It’ll work for me too!” But they don't do their own research. They jump in at the latest phases, when the real community (the ones who do due diligence) has already taken their profits.

My Hypothesis:

Let’s tie this all together with a simple hypothesis:

Right now, an estimated 10-20 million people are using XRP. But what if XRP becomes so widely adopted that the number of users increases dramatically—let’s say to 1 billion people?

How much would the price of XRP rise then? How many coins would be burned with those transactions?

Summary:

To summarize, I believe the price of XRP could potentially multiply by a significant factor in the future. This is due to factors like political acceptance, growing adoption by financial institutions and banks, technological advancements, and an artificial scarcity created by the burning of coins as more users adopt XRP.

But again, this is just my theory. What do you all think? Do you believe it's worth getting involved, or should we stay away?",0

Kaspa: A solid project that is way undervalued right now due to a massive FUD campaign recently, but with lots of upcoming catalysts just around the corner.  It seems like it does all the things that Satoshi hoped BTC would do as a currency.  Has handled daily transaction volumes higher than ETH without issues, and real volume not node to node comunication or otherwise exaggerated volume metrics like was often quoted with SOL.  Kaspa was just listed on Kraken. Atomic swaps just went live.  It has a thriving KRC20 ecosystem.  Grayscale put it on their digital currencies under consideration list along with BTC, LTC, XRP. Binance listing is just around the corner.  10bps mainnet coming in Feb '25 making it fastest PoW chain.  Smart contracts this summer.  Multiple industrial initiatives just around the corner via KII.


Arweave: Great adoption across multiple blockchains and crypto projects.  Kraken listing upcoming per Kraken roadmap. On Grayscale's AI crypto list. AO blockchain coming in Feb. It's revolutionary tech that will allow blockchain distributed LLMs (or any other complex programs) with state memory.


Chainlink: Agree Link is great and way undervalued.  There were some tokenomics issues, but seems like that's being worked out.

XRP,2025-01-29,post,CryptoMarkets,I believe we are watching Ripple Labs making an attempt to become the crypto FED.,"Full disclosure I do own XRP. However, I personally I do not favor what I believe is Ripple Labs current strategy.

The idea that Ripple is working to get their assets included in any potential Federal crypto reserve makes sense for them as a private business. However I believe they are looking at that is step one in trying to position themselves as essentially a crypto FED.  

As including the assets that Ripple Labs controls (and still owns huge portions of the float) would give them unprecedented control over a major asset of the Federal Government, to the point of giving them leverage over future crypto related policy choices.  As this marriage would cement the dynamic of As goes Ripple so goes the quality of the Federal crypto reserves.

I do not believe one company should have this power, I see no benefit for the US, or it’s citizens, other than the price run up in whatever Ripple Labs asset gets included in a crypto reserve.

I believe this power Ripple
would gain would result in a future “power check” by. A future administration and my hypothesis is that Ripple Labs would become a crypto FED, at a great cost to US tax payers.

Any thoughts on this from the world’s most relevant crypto community?

how stupid am i. any advice? i need a 2x with what i have left to break even. any advice on what large stable coins to put in hopes i break even when/ if altcoin season starts. idk if i should maybe put the rest in xrp/sol, otc all it a day and hope one day the market recovers and i get a 2x. 

i just want my money back. i have no trading experience, never really even traded stocks much besides basic index funds or anything before getting into crypto, and i had no business investing all this money into crypto let alone these small to mid cap coins. i also based life based on some of these price predictions from youtubers and different charting TA accounts and my alts have completely plummeted instead. i sold because i was afriad they would plummet even more and when the market did recover they wouldnt pump enough to my point of entry.

XRP,2025-05-22,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: When to take profits?...,"You could split your strategy into individual goals. For example, you might have an absolute price to sell everything, but take some small wins along the way.

Say you invested in btc at 20k. You decide you will get out at 400% But you will also take 5% of your profit when it hits 100%. And then 10% when it hits 200%. You obviously risk it never reaching the upper limits but that's the gamble. Additionally, if you pull out at 400% you're not exposed to further gains.

You might keep it simple and when your initial investment hits +25% you take out your original ""stake"" and invest in a long term plan or put in fiat savings or buy the lambo! Then the remaining you have new objectives for.

Having a firm strategy can help you stay accountable and not be led by emotions like fud or fomo

I'm still not sure. I got burnt before Selling at 11k and not getting in at 25k and many newbie things. So i didn't sell from 55k unless i need some for real life sh1t. But i sold 20% at 103k and bought 3-4 stocks with it.

And there is some correlation but if things work out they will pump more than btc. And i will sell them and buy btc. Maybe try to catch a dip as well.

I know many thinks now or 120k is the top and i think we gonna dip a bit if we got 120k but there is a good chance it will continue.

And if it does to let's say 150k and max bullish 200k. Is Selling only 20% then smart or 50% or more..

Many ppl say dont sell because most ppl r either idiots or newbies. But if u have some experience j think u can do a bit better.

XRP,2025-04-14,post,CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin and Ethereum or only Bitcoin?,"I keep a small chunk of my BTC on an exchange, so I can be getting free sats from interest / APY.

If I'm to buy ETH, I will use it as a liquidity and put it in a crypto savings account (for interest).

Is this a good idea? The point is, assuming ETH also grows in value more or less or just stays stable but doesn't devalue like fiat, I can always sell it and use the money in case of emergency without having to sell Bitcoin.

There is a psychological barrier that prevents me from selling sats.

Also, selling sats is never a good idea, because the price may skyrocket after you sell.

If the ETH price increases after I sell, it will be just a minor increase, so I'm not missing out like it would happen if the price of BTC increases.

Your psychological barrier with BTC is actually pretty common - lots of us treat BTC like digital gold that we never want to touch.

ETH makes sense as your liquidity play. The APY is usually better than BTC, and like you said, if you need to sell some, it won't hurt as much mentally. Plus, the ETH ecosystem is pretty robust with DeFi options if you want to explore that route later.

Just keep in mind:

\* Don't keep too much on exchanges - they're not your keys, not your coins

\* APY rates can change quickly

\* Factor in gas fees for ETH transactions

\* Keep track of everything for tax purposes (what a pain)

Your strategy of using ETH as a buffer to protect your BTC stack is solid. It's like having a savings account (ETH) and a long-term investment account (BTC). The key is finding the right balance between the two that lets you sleep at night.

Based on what you're describing, a 70/30 or 80/20 split (BTC/ETH) might work well - enough ETH for liquidity but still heavily weighted toward BTC for long-term growth.",1

It really just seems sketchy but there are tools that look for patterns of scammers and such which I think is a good thing. 

The ability to create coins with behaviors is pretty awesome and can accomplish a goal, but in a lot of cases the question is, is it better than the current system?

For example, the coin I made, CZLumen, I can mint, burn, transfer ownership, renounce ownership and add liquidity. It's not on any markets at the moment, there's 900 million and I own 80% of it and put a million for sale. So far the whole thing cost me over 400 dollars and I don't think I'll get a return. 

This basically makes me a bank of this coin with its value placed on trust me with adding or removing tokens to change scarcity. 

The second layer is if I did blanket sell, early buyers could buy and rug pull as the value increases and people late to buy end up with a loss. I don't know how to handle that. 

Other tools for these coins are pretty neat, like gaining interest, a tax per transaction, burn per transaction and so on which can create these really cool, almost organic behaviors, but I don't really want to drop more money into exploring that due to cost. 

If the altcoin is serving a goal like raising funding for something, I suppose it's a good thing. But with things going the way they are, we may soon have more alt coins than people.",1

XRP,2025-06-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Any explanation for crypto prices not moving...,"I'm not going to lie, but summer time is always slow as shit for crypto...June to September is when things tend to crab. It's always been like this for the last several cycles. I have a feeling that things might heat up end of August and into September before peaking in October, and if they do it's only for a short while, and you have to have an exit strategy or you will get smoked.

Don't marry coins. If you're going to hold, hold BTC and BTC ONLY. Do NOT hold alt coins between cycles, EVER. One thing that every alt coin bag holder has and will learn and will have to learn, one way or another, hard or easy. That shit will tank much worse than BTC does if things go south. Always DCA into whatever it is you're buying into, don't go in all at once, because one never knows which direction the market could turn and it can happen with very little in the way of warning. People think that the market will keep trending higher, it's human instinct to think that you're going to just keep winning, but the tables turn...every time and that time is no different to the time before and time before that.

Always play it safe, but be smart about it.

You know it's cooked, you know the market is not playing most of us nicely (and was never intended to - it was designed to enrich the top guns at the expensive of little guys like you and I). You know what is going on, as I do, and as most of us know. The market is crabbing and there isn't a single thing we can do about it, except hope that things start trending upwards as we come out of August.

If you hold shitty alts, you can only hope that institutions will buy into them (good luck with that), and stick to BTC if you want to play the HODLing game, because we know what has happened the last 4 cycles, and we know where BTC is and where it was. As for alts, they are a shitshow, a side circus with some wonderful entertainment and a get-rich-quick vibe that we know always turns to a pile of steaming horseshit in the end.

Play it safe. Play BTC, and stop complaining.",6

XRP,2025-07-09,post,CryptoMarkets,New to Crypto,"Hey everyone. Long story short I'm new to crypto. My coworker/buddy got me into it and I'm trying to gather as much information as possible to make the best decisions possible. Virtually all of my investing is retirement based (S&P 500 for my forecasted retirement year) coming directly out of my paycheck from my employer. I felt like crypto was a good opportunity to have different things in my portfolio. Therefore, I have a couple of questions

1.) What are you guys liking the look of moving forward (besides BTC). Between reddit and friends who seemingly know what they're doing, 
I hear a lot about XLM, XRP, ICP, LINK, HBAR, and ALGO. 

2.) What criteria do you consider when investing in particular coins? 

3.) Where do you get your crypto news/insight from besides reddit?

Hopefully this post doesn't seem too rudimentary.  Appreciate any help and insight!",5
XRP,2025-07-09,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: New to Crypto...,If you’re gonna invest in anything besides Bitcoin be prepared to watch your investment closely because Bitcoin is the only one you want to hold long term. Although people will make argument that there favorite coin is a long term hold don’t listen to them. Everything you buy that isn’t Bitcoin should be held short term and sold during peak periods to buy more Bitcoin which you should buy in the bear market,5
XRP,2025-07-09,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: New to Crypto...,"Crypto is volatile still. You can throw money into bitcoin but who knows what will happen. Experts everyday say ""its gonna go huge"" ""Its stalled"" ""its peaked"" ""its gonna drop"".

I was taking  cypto advice from ""experts"" when I realized no one has any idea and every single major site and newsletter and social media account says completely different things all on the same day while claiming to always be right.. Even all the cycle experts are scrambling to justify why the cycle isnt happening and these are the ""paid professional"" guys.

If you want to daily manage something go for alt coins but be prepared from big losses as much as big gains. But you need to work at it all the time.

You can always just by bitcoin and hold. The past says this is the best thing to do but the future is so unknown at this stage. Who knows? Its a total gamble.

Everyone is claiming the next alt coin explosion. ""Ethereum is about to go crazy for this and that reason"" but reality is if you invested in it 4 years ago you are still down and that money would have been better in ETFS.

XRP is up at the moment but is trending down compared to where it was 6 months ago. (people will cry about this not being trie but look at the all time chat).

The thing is everyone will say ""but they are about to explode!!! The problem is people have been saying this for years. Most of this comes from major social media accounts and people just parrot it on places like reddit.

My point here is sure get into crypto but figure out in what way you want to do it. Realize most advice on where prices with go is 99% speculation. Yes there is big money to be made but you need to be open to big risk to do it. For every guy whos made a huge amount there is many who are broke. Dont get sucked into the hype of crypto social media accounts with big claims and watch out for the parrots of these claims all over places like reddit.

There is plenty of news letters. Milk road is good. But dont get sucked into their paid section. You are just wasting investment money on speculation. These newsletter will all claim you can copy their trades because they have so much success but anyone who bought crypto and held years ago has had huge gains. It was luck not skill. They were just early adopters.

The answer to these type of questions in crypto of ""should I do this"" is always ""yes and no"" lol.

Personally I would hold crypto with the few major ones as a percent of my entire portfolio. Just watch and see markets in case something looks to crash to you can get out early (you can also buy back at the dip). Keep topping up as you go along with your regular stock investments and anything else. This is why we diversify. To manage risk. This way it wont matter too much what happens with your crypto as you are covered in gold or etfs for example.",2

From the little but I've read on the CLARITY Act, some of it is good for crypto, but a lot of it seems totally counterintuitive to why it was created. I teach high school economics and government and I sort of sit there and think ""I don't totally understand unless you wanted to do questionable things with your money"".

A lot of times all the alts retrace their entire short term pump alll the way back to lows while bitcoin pumps because they’re simply just profit vehicles and do more oscillating than long term appreciation. Generally bitcoin pumps first and if it goes sideways for a while, traders will take profit into the coins starting with the bigger market caps and then if bitcoin still pumps and goes sideways or stays sideways at high enough levels, it’ll trickle into the smaller and smaller cap ones.

XRP,2025-07-12,post,CryptoMarkets,Why altcoins underperform BTC: imagine permanent sell limit orders,"Let's do a thought experiment.

Currently Strategy holds \~3% of Bitcoin supply. Average purchase price is \~$70k. Michael Saylor says he plans to never sell bitcoin. Also, 95% of total bitcoin supply is in circulation now - only \~5% left to be mined.

What would happen if Saylor changes his mind and decides to start selling, say, up to 50% of his BTC holdings at exactly $120k price (as an example)? You can imagine this as a **permanent sell limit order** with the price of $120k and enormous volume (1.5% of supply). Of course, technically it doesn't look like that, but conceptually it's the same: every time the price goes to $120k, the big seller would arrive and drive it back down.  
**The price would likely not go past $120k for a while** \- because even when demand grows, MSTR will always be there to sell some more of their bag at $120k.

**And now imagine** if Strategy held not 3%, but 30% of Bitcoin supply. Average purchase price is not $70k, but $7k. And Saylor's goal is to make money in short/medium term, so he's ready to sell every time the price goes up. Heck, he could even sell when the price is stable or goes down - he would still make a lot of money on top of $7k cost basis. Just need to not sell a lot at once, because that would scare retail investors.

Could BTC ever keep going up under such conditions?

**This is what happens with most altcoins**. It has nothing to do with the tech itself. The tech can be awesome, but the token ownership incentivizes early investors to sell whenever the demand grows, limiting the price growth potential. And that will continue to happen until they sell their big bags, which can be 50% of total token supply, or even more.

**What about memecoins?** Don't they have a more fair token distribution? Not really. They still have founders and early adopters - lucky people who got 1%+ of supply each for minimal prices. When the price goes 10x-100x and the token enters, say, top 100 of CMC - they will start to sell, limiting the price growth.

How can we identify altcoins that can outperform BTC in the long run? There is no guarantee, but here are a few metrics that we can look at, and compare it with BTC.

**1. % of supply in circulation.** Every time a token unlock happens, early investors get the token for free -  so they will always be incentivized to sell, driving the price down. If the token has, say, <80% in circulation, we can't expect the price to outperform BTC just because of this reason. BTC has 95%.

**2. % of supply held by whales**. A whale in CMC terminology is a wallet that holds >1% of total token supply. So if this number is, say, higher than 10%, we can expect that whale to sell when demand grows, to make profit. For BTC only 1.25% of total supply is controlled by whales.

**3. Historical price action in BTC.** There were big waves of retail demand for altcoins in the past. We can look at price of the token in BTC, not USD. For most of altcoins, it has a clear pattern: there is a surge every few years, and then a slow drop. And the surges usually get lower, and drops get deeper. Unless the tech makes a groundbreaking advancement and adoption explodes, we can expect the pattern to continue. And just to be clear, the adoption has to be bigger than the adoption for BTC. Because the whales holding 1%+ of supply will keep selling, so the demand needs to smash past that. It's much harder for altcoins than for BTC just because there are typically much bigger whales in terms of % of supply held.

Here is the analysis of top 20 coins (CMC data):

|Rank|Token|% supply in circulation|% supply held by whales|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1**|**BTC**|**95**|**1.25**|
|2|ETH|100|47|
|3|XRP|59|No data|
|4|USDT|98|25|
|5|BNB|100|No data|
|6|SOL|89|No data|

|18|LEO|94|99.5|
|19|SHIB|100|61|
|20|TON|48|68|

**So is there any reason to invest in altcoins at all?**

I think the tech has potential, but projects should be selected very carefully. I don't think it makes sense to invest in projects with <80% supply in circulation (unless you're a huge believer in the specific tech) or with >10% held by whales. However, there is one exception to the last point. It is possible that the project foundation controls the large portion of supply (e.g. ETH, TRX), but they can be trusted that they won't limit the price action by constantly selling. I think TRX is the best example of this. Justin Sun controls \~70% of token supply, however apparently he makes the TRX price action follow the BTC price, so the TRX graph in BTC is quite stable since \~2020.

So even though TRX does not outperform BTC, at least it follows it. It's a rare exception for projects with large % of token supply controlled by whales. I think it's not a coincidence that Sun was [giving advice](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/01/22/justin-sun-claims-he-can-take-ethereum-to-10000/) to ETH foundation on how to keep the price up. And still, it does not guarantee that the whales won't dump their bags if adoption explodes and demand suddenly goes up. They might make sure the graph in BTC stays consistent, and still sell the excess of supply - so retail investors still won't make more money than they could in BTC.

Please share your thoughts in comments, and feel free to recommend projects with good tokenomics and small % controlled by whales.",13
XRP,2025-07-12,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Why altcoins underperform BTC: imagine permanent s...,"Let's be honest. Most alt coins are scams, and the people buying them are gamblers. It doesn't matter if ""the tech is good"", because there's too much incentive for early adopters to pull the rug. You need a token like bitcoin where all the coins are mined. Anytime you have a set up where a founder has all the tokens and then sells them off one by one it's going to be a scam, because it didn't cost anything to create those tokens. In other words they have zero real value, and you're either going to get rug pulled or diluted because the founder knows those coins are actually worthless. .  Bitcoin > shitcoins",8

XRP,2025-01-17,post,CryptoMarkets,Potential Altcoin Rally and Precautions,"
What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin in the Upcoming Period? What Happened in the 2021 Altcoin Rally? How Long Will the Altcoin Rally Last and How Will It Unfold?

I will answer the questions of what we should do to not miss the altcoin rally, whether an altcoin rally is necessary, and more in detail.

First, let's examine what happened during the 2021 Bull Market and the Altcoin Rally, particularly in the last quarter of the Bull Market, and look at what occurred in Bitcoin Dominance:

In the 2021 Bull Market, the most enthusiastic phase of the altcoin rally started in the last quarter of the Bull Market, specifically in January 2021. At that time, Bitcoin dropped by 30% from $42,000 to $29,000, and Bitcoin dominance fell for 5 months, decreasing from 70% to 40%. After this drop to $29,000, Bitcoin rose by 2x from $29,000 to $65,000. However, altcoins, which had been lagging behind Bitcoin for a long time, surged 50x to 100x, marking their real rally.

Looking back at the 2021 Bull Market, from the March 2020 crash at $3,150 until January 2021, Bitcoin increased about 13 times, while altcoins were stagnant. When Bitcoin dominance reached its peak at 70% in January 2021, and dominance started to fall, Bitcoin only increased by 2x, while altcoins surged 50x to 100x.

Regarding Bitcoin dominance, it is inaccurate to say that ""once Bitcoin dominance reaches 70%, an altcoin rally begins."" Bitcoin dominance first hit 70% in July 2019, and it remained stuck between 70% and 60% until January 2021.

In the current period, most altcoins are down by 50% from their recent highs. Many altcoins completed their rallies before the 50% drop, and back in December 2023, when Bitcoin dominance was at 55%, people were already saying, ""Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are at 55%, the altcoin rally is coming soon, let’s prepare our retirement portfolio."" I shared my thoughts on this back in December 2023.

Here is an excerpt from my December 2023 post:

___

When Bitcoin dominance hit 70% in July 2019, we said, ""Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are rising together, dominance may have peaked, and the altcoin rally will start soon."" We then added the top 10 altcoins of that time to our ""altcoin portfolio"" and awaited the drop in Bitcoin dominance to trigger the altcoin rally.

As you can see, our altcoin portfolio, made when Bitcoin dominance was at 70%, ended up with an average of -70% losses. If we had invested a significant amount into this portfolio without leaving any cash aside, during the long bear market of 1.5 years, our funds would have been severely eroded. As the market began to rise and we believed the bull market had started, many of us would have invested all our funds, only to see a 70% drop again. Our psychology would have been severely affected, family relationships strained, and our sleep disturbed. Some would have irrationally turned to gamble-like thinking, trying to recover their losses by putting all their remaining funds into the market, risking everything.

I believe there is a great deal of misinformation on Twitter regarding the interpretation of Bitcoin dominance, which has led many to be misdirected. I think that Bitcoin dominance may be approaching a peak around 55%. The altcoin rally in the final quarter of the next bull market could be triggered by Bitcoin dominance falling from 55% to 25%-30%. Personally, I believe this scenario will unfold during the final quarter of the next bull market. However, my main question is: how do we know for sure that Bitcoin dominance's rise will trigger the altcoin rally? We have seen such events before, but we cannot know with certainty when it will happen again.

Even now, when Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are both rising, and altcoins are falling, people are prematurely declaring the bull market has definitely begun and the altcoin rally is imminent, which I believe is highly dangerous and misleading.

___

Three months after my December 2023 post, most altcoins have experienced a 50% drop.

Back when Bitcoin was around $16,000-$17,000, I predicted that during the upcoming rise, Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance would rise together, meaning altcoins would see relatively less profit and that altcoins would likely see losses against Bitcoin. I switched to Bitcoin, and when Bitcoin dominance hit the 50%-58% range, I began shifting back into altcoins and transparently shared my altcoin portfolio.

Looking ahead, if the 2019 intermediate rally had unfolded differently, we would have expected a 50% drop in Bitcoin and a 70% drop in altcoins before the peak was reached. Initially, I thought we might see a drop from $42,000 to $29,000, but I was wrong. Now, Bitcoin has surpassed the previous peak of $65,000 without experiencing a similar crash, but most altcoins have completed their intermediate rally and are in the decline phase.

As for Bitcoin dominance, it first reached 70% in July 2019, and after a 530-day squeeze between 70% and 60%, it eventually fell to 40%, followed by a 4-month altcoin rally. Today, Bitcoin dominance has been stuck between 50% and 55% for around 200 days. A decline from this level could trigger an altcoin rally lasting about 4 months.

My personal view is that the bull market will follow the pattern of previous cycles, with the most likely peak happening between April and May 2025.

This suggests that after the summer of 2024, we should expect the rise to begin, and the altcoin rally could start by the end of 2024. However, if we experience an unprecedentedly long bull market, it could extend until the end of 2025. This is also a possibility, and if this happens, our expectations will be delayed by 6-7 months. Given the uncertainty, we should remain cautious, avoid margin trading, and focus on spot trading to protect ourselves from any unexpected crashes.

Looking at the altcoin rally in 2021, examining the coins that performed well, such as Hot, Chz, Avax, Solana, Band, Wrx, Matic, Sand, and Doge, we can analyze how the upcoming altcoin rally may unfold.

In my posts, I typically mention that the altcoin rally in the final 4 months of a bull market will occur in 3 phases. Let’s take a closer look at these phases.

**Phase 1: ""Excluding Old Investors""**

After a few months of modest gains, we will witness a sharp 70%-100% increase in altcoins in a single day. This will be followed by a 50% drop. During this phase, most people will begin selling their assets, and many will fall into the dangerous mindset of ""I sold at the peak, I will never buy again."" This will cause many to miss out on the true altcoin rally.

**Phase 2: ""Big Regret""**

After the 50% drop, a short-term zig-zag pattern will unfold, lasting around 30 days, with significant gains and losses. This phase will be psychologically exhausting for many investors, as they experience the emotional rollercoaster of regret for missing out on the earlier rally.

**Phase 3: ""The Swamp""**

The final phase, which typically lasts 2 weeks, is when altcoins will see an explosive rise of 100%-500% within a short period. This phase is crucial, as it marks the transition from euphoric gains to the beginning of the bear market, with altcoins dropping by 75% from their peak.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

The crypto market is highly volatile, and no one can predict with certainty what will happen next. However, based on historical patterns, I strongly believe that an altcoin rally, similar to what we saw in the 2021 bull market, is inevitable. The influx of new investors into the market is driven by altcoins, and their spectacular rises act as advertisements to draw in new money.

While participating in this market, it’s essential to avoid the ""I’ve solved this market"" mentality. The most dangerous psychological trap in crypto is overconfidence, which leads many investors to make irrational decisions, and often lose everything.

Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that in crypto, you are more likely to be the prey than the predator. Properly managing your risk, setting clear goals, and understanding the potential pitfalls can help you navigate this market more successfully.

Be cautious and remain aware of the risks.

XRP,2025-01-17,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Potential Altcoin Rally and Precautions...,"TL;DR: Potential Altcoin Rally and Precautions

2021 Altcoin Rally Review:

Altcoins saw explosive gains (50x-100x) only after Bitcoin peaked and its dominance fell from 70% to 40%.

Bitcoin’s rise (13x from March 2020 to January 2021) preceded the altcoin rally, during which altcoins underperformed until dominance dropped.


Current Market Dynamics:

Bitcoin dominance (currently 50%-55%) has been stagnant for ~200 days. Historically, a fall in dominance to 25%-30% triggers altcoin rallies lasting ~4 months.

Most altcoins are down ~50% from recent highs; many completed their intermediate rallies and are now in decline.


Historical Patterns:

In the 2019 rally, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 70% before falling and triggering a rally. Today’s pattern suggests Bitcoin dominance may peak at 55%, potentially sparking an altcoin rally by late 2024 or early 2025.


Phases of an Altcoin Rally:

1. Excluding Old Investors: Initial sharp 70%-100% gains followed by a 50% drop—many investors sell out prematurely.


2. Big Regret: A zigzag phase lasting ~30 days, exhausting investors emotionally.


3. The Swamp: Final euphoric 100%-500% rise within weeks, followed by a bear market where altcoins lose ~75% from their peak.



Market Outlook:

Most likely bull market peak: April-May 2025.

Possible altcoin rally by late 2024 if Bitcoin dominance declines.

Extended bull market (end of 2025) is possible, but caution is advised.


Precautions:

Avoid overconfidence; crypto is volatile and unpredictable.

Stick to spot trading, manage risks, and be ready for sharp corrections.

Learn from past cycles to avoid emotional and financial pitfalls.



Key Takeaway: Historical patterns indicate a significant altcoin rally is likely in the final months of the bull market. However, timing is uncertain, and proper risk management is essential to avoid severe losses.",8

Retail will not be entering coins with chinese developers or european dev teams. Retail will not be going to grap obscure meme coins from god knows where. Like it or not this is the new reality. There will be some that pump but it will not be like the previous bull runs like everything you pick goes up.

Tens of billion dollar market cap dino coins will pump because now centralisation and bending the knee is the new norm. Blackrock and others will siphon the retail money to btc and their other etfs of ""big"" and ""known"" coins aka dinos.

Yes, it’s a very uncertain moment in all markets and the general world economy, but that’s when you should be considering what to buy! Not what to sell.

(I didn’t say *rush to buy*, but we can flick through the discount racks, right?)

So with that in mind, what are you considering stacking more of, or adding to your portfolio?

And not just the usual larger cap ones! (HBAR, SUI, XML, etc, shillers are always welcome…little tired of XRP shillers tho.) I’m particularly interested to know what people are considering outside the top 20?

Prices are crushed in many cases, and may have a way further to go down yet (this is a crypto sub, in case you forgot!) but there are solid projects out there, some even showing price resilience through the past 10 days on the carnage/elation/carnage rollercoaster. 

But before I lead the witness and start shilling. Anyone else considering where to buy right now? Please discuss…",1

XRP,2025-01-16,post,CryptoMarkets,XRP @ $3... HODL or Sell?,"This is a happy moment for XRP holders or investors. I have always believed that the coin is getting high buying pressure which will take its price up and finally we are able to see the coin price at 3 dollar which is a very good price I would say. I don't know whether this is the highest or we can get even better price for the coin in market because the kind of attention people are giving to the coin is good.

This is also because the security and exchange commission chairman Mr Garry is taking an exit this month and after that the new person will not be going against the project and the company which means that the lawsuit is kind of over.

Now as the price has gone of significantly in last one week so I feel like that it is the time when we need to wait and see how the market will perform.

If this price stable for some time then we might see even better price in the coming week. This is why it's worth waiting for some more time and see how things take shape. I am invested on xrp but I want to book a profit when the price is pretty much high because if I do it early then it will be a disease that I might regret later and this is why I am just waiting for the right moment when I can book some profit that I feel like it's a good range to do that and this is my plan for now.

The answer for Uniswap is liquidity and transaction volume. For an exchange, that’s a big advantage and I think they’ll continue to hold on to it. The more people use Uniswap, the more appealing it is to use, especially if you’re transacting large volumes and need serious liquidity.

XRP,2024-11-24,post,CryptoMarkets,Why it is apparently not the bull run for altcoins yet ?,"Hello guys,

I read here and there that we are apparently not in the bull run for altcoins (altcoins season) yet, and that it should arrive during 2025, so maybe in 3-6 months or so.

However, some altcoins are going crazy right now, reminds me of last February/march, we see some big ups of around « 100% in a week/in a month » (among them, XRP).
Of course, most ATH have not been reached yet, but price is rising for almost every altcoin.

So why is it not considered a bullrun yet ? Is « bullrun » a specific term that means that things will go even crazier, with ATH reached very quickly ? So is it normal to have this kind of bullish trend right now, 3-6 months before bull run, or is it just a hype and we could expect some downs and corrections before bull run ?",28

XRP,2024-11-24,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Why it is apparently not the bull run for altcoins...,"We've just begun the 2nd and biggest bull run. These things follow a similar trajectory every 4 years and is initiated by the 4 year halving cycle. It always goes for a similar length of time, so it's expected to peak first around summer 2025 and then Fall 2025.

It typically goes BTC -> alt coins -> meme coins.

This is because of:

* media attention: as Bitcoin starts to increase in value beyond all-time highs, more people invest in it causing a snowball effect.
* people see BTC won't give as solid of returns, so they look to alt-coins. They see that they don't give as solid of returns so they look to riskier meme coins which because of the low price and attention, have an opportunity to skyrocket in price. If a coin is .000000001c and then goes to .50 cents. That's an insane gain.

So it has to do with how attention to the industry works. We likely won't see the top of alt coins until mid-late 2025. This is nothing.

BTC could go to $300-400k this cycle depending on media attention. We're going to see corporations, wealthy elites, pension funds, celebrities, governments, etc buying BTC.",6

XRP,2025-07-01,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP...,"If you're new to crypto.. One of the fundamental principles to try and understand is the market capitalisation. Similarly to stocks.. The MC is the total value of all the coins in circulation at the current price. You can estimate max worth of a coin, if you think the market cap is reasonable (generally compared to BTC)

The tricky thing about XRP is that not all coins are released into circulation. Current circulating supply is 59B, but max supply will be 100B. The means there is 41B coins that aren't available for purchase yet, but will be released in the future. So if hypothetically the MC remains the same as it is today.. The remaining 41B of coins to release will dilute the cost of each coin by roughly 40%

It is a double edged sword, as if XRP was to maintain its current price as more coins are released, the MC would need to expand by roughly 40%

This is called an inflationary (crypto)currency. It means that naturally the value of each coin is going to decrease, without significant demand to offset the inflation rate",7

Generally speaking though, once all tokens are in circulating supply - there will be no more inflation effect and XRP will switch to being slightly deflationary as coins are inadvertently lost.

I am interested in investing in ADA and XRP, but I feel that their current prices are unreasonably high.

Additionally, isn’t it unlikely that their prices will rise substantially further after these events, considering how high they already are?

I bought a lot of ADA back in 2020 right after it went up 4X (from 2 to 8 cents). It wasn't easy since I figured a 50% pull back was probable but I knew where we were in the 4 year cycle. From where I bought it didn't go down much and it went up 39X (8 cents to 3.10). Had it tanked I would have added more. The 4 year cycle has proven to be more similar than not, including the alt seasons within the cycle. A 39X from here isn't likely because of the higher market cap but a lot higher from here seems more likely than not and I will take that bet every time. $4-$6 ADA in the next few months wouldn't surprise me. It blows my mind how many people in the space including large buyers are clueless about the 4 year cycles and the BTC dominance waterfall drop that started march 2017 and march 2021.

I’ve been following XRP for a while now, especially with the recent price movements and the ongoing discussions about its legal status and market potential. I understand it’s had a rocky history with the SEC and that some are really bullish while others are more cautious.

Right now, XRP is sitting around $2.35 USD (\~$3.70 AUD), and I’ve seen some predictions ranging from $4 to $11 USD for 2025 and beyond. But I’d really love to hear what this community thinks.

**A few questions I’d appreciate your thoughts on:**

* What are your predictions for XRP over the next year or two?
* How much do you think regulatory clarity will impact its price?
* Do you see major institutional adoption happening anytime soon?
* Are there specific indicators or milestones you're watching for before investing (or exiting)?

Any thoughts, advice, or useful links would be appreciated. I'm just trying to make a more informed decision and learn from people who've been in this space longer than I have.

Therefore, I want a good app that doesn't have much withdrawal or investment fees but is stable and trustworthy. 

I would also appreciate it if you could suggest a few cryptos for short-term investment and also some for long-term investment. I don't want to do daily trading, as I am a bit occupied with my research work. But I would happily trade weekly or monthly for the short-term investment.

Stick to DCA weekly or monthly to manage risk without constant trading.,2
XRP,2025-04-24,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Need some advice to start fresh...,"Sorry about your experience with WazirX - getting hacked really sucks. For the US market, Coinbase is your best bet, especially as a beginner. Their interface is stupid simple and their security is solid. The fees aren't too bad either (0.05-0.60%).

For your investment strategy with $300-500:

Long term (70% of your portfolio):

\* Bitcoin (BTC) - the OG crypto, still king

\* Ethereum (ETH) - backbone of most blockchain projects

Short term (30%):

\* Look for established altcoins in the top 20-30 by market cap

\* Don't chase random moonshots, they're usually pump and dumps

Since you're busy with research work, stick to a simple DCA (dollar-cost averaging) approach. Put in a fixed amount monthly into your long-term picks, and maybe check prices weekly for short-term moves.

Quick heads up - if you end up trading more frequently down the line, Coinbase One subscription removes trading fees up to $10k monthly. But for your current amount, the regular fees are fine.

Been through what you're dealing with. Start small, learn the platform, and don't FOMO into random coins just because someone on Reddit (including me) tells you to. And always enable 2FA - seriously, do it right after setting up your account.",2

With that being said, what are some coins you recommend to research. So far I have my eyes set out on XRP, Algo and possibly doge. I’m not a BTC type of person simply because the money I’m putting won’t really give me huge returns.

I use Kraken but will probably migrate since certain coins like HBAR aren’t on there. But I need to do research on that part since I don’t want to pay stupid amounts on fees or going to a exchange that’s dog shit",1

XRP,2025-01-22,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Need advice, I want to take advantage of the crypt...","Careful with XRP research. If by ""research"" you mean you're seeing a lot of sycophantic support and reposting of recycled articles, you're just getting sucked into a fan-club of mostly delusional optimists who desperately hope for another 460+%. 

Outside of speculation based on quotes by XRP team, speculators, and rumors, SBI Holdings in Japan is the only ""huge"" institutional interest that has expressed and documented proof of adoption. That adoption was in the form of testing (alongside LINK, AAVE and others). This was revealed in a 169 slide powerpoint document from a 2017 information meeting. XRP was mentioned in ~3 slides.

The other bullish news (that still gets posted weekly on Reddit) is a quote by the SBI CEO from 2019 where he said, ""80% of Japanese banks will be using XRP by 2025."" Not even close to that yet, and of the banks that have been rumored to have adopted it or were confirmed to be testing it back in 2017, its not clear that they're still doing so. 

LINK seems to be quite favored by institutions, and LTC is almost certainly getting an ETF and is already one of the three tradeable cryptos on Fidelity. 

SUI decouples from the broader crypto market frequently and is a pretty solid (theoretical) alternative to SOL with slightly less shitcoins and a few attempts at ""utility"" coins launched on their ecosystem. Excellent for reliably swing trading too. Any time you're holding SUI you can swap your SUI for DEEP on the SUI ecosystem and see twice to triple the gains SUI itself does. 

Good luck, and please disregard blog posts and crypto articles people post that do dick-all for sourcing. Use google's search operators when researching. Filetype: for pdfs, csv, doc, etc. site: for corroborating ""quotes"" or claims allegedly made by an institution.

If you can't verify the claim from the primary source being discussed, then it didn't happen and the poster knows shit about fuck.",8

XRP,2025-04-21,post,CryptoMarkets,My friend asked me what shit coin to pick. Here was my advice.,"
If you estimate the potential gains from its current price, remember that the main hype occurred when it was much lower initially. While it's possible for the price to increase 100x to 1000x beyond this point, the market conditions required for that would be unrealistic.  

To assess whether a stock (or cryptocurrency) can reach a certain price, research the necessary market conditions and make a reasonable judgment.  

For example, for Dogecoin to hit a specific price target, it might require something like a 200% increase in trading volume, reaching, say, $50 billion—which, while not impossible, would be highly unlikely. (Note: These are not actual Dogecoin numbers, just an illustration.)

- Choose good tech with the best vision like (I choosed crypto money)

- Open and big community

- Low liquidity on exchange ( the holders are true believers on the technology for long term )


- When big news happen and market crashed ( bitcoin crashing by 10% or more ) stack more of this coin

I've heard a few different narratives from crypto insiders I trust who are typically right about these things and basically from what I understand, any alt-season that happens within the next year will likely only apply to utility alts and not as much to meme coins. Stick with coins with good utility (which is what you really should be doing anyway). In my personal opinion, I think tokens like ETH, ADA, SOL, XRP, LINK, AVAX, HBAR, SUI, and others, will have their moment. It just will be when people least expect it, as usual. Big players are accumulating ethereum and other alts at the moment. You really think this is the first time that retail investors perfectly time the top and the big money loses? I think there's almost no way this happens lol too many retail investors who sold and are feeling smart and expecting everything to dump. Crypto typically takes the path of max pain. If you can't stomach it, you will get flushed out while the patient make money in the long term. Regardless of what happens this year or even next year, I strongly believe the long term trajectory of all the projects I mentioned (plus BTC) will be up, up and away. All signs point to some epic bullish price action in the future as demand for crypto assets becomes unprecedented. We are still pretty early in the grand scheme of things. I see BTC at this point as pretty much a force of nature which does what it wants, when it wants and doesn't care about what people think or expect will happen.",1

XRP,2025-05-28,post,CryptoMarkets,Everyone’s Watching Price. No One’s Watching Bitcoin’s Quantum Vulnerability.,"Bitcoin is sold as digital gold, a hedge against inflation, a symbol of freedom from central banks. But there’s one thing it’s not, and nobody in the media wants to admit it: Bitcoin is not built to survive the future.

We’re heading into a quantum age. Fast. And when real quantum computers arrive, they won’t just outperform classical systems—they’ll break them. Bitcoin included. Here’s why: every Bitcoin transaction relies on something called ECDSA, a cryptographic system that keeps your private keys secure. But once you send Bitcoin, your public key is exposed. In today’s world, that’s fine. But in a quantum world? That’s game over. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s can take your public key and calculate your private key. Just like that, the vault door swings open and anyone can take what’s inside.

It’s not theoretical. If you’ve ever sent Bitcoin, your wallet will be vulnerable when quantum computing hits scale. And because Bitcoin’s blockchain is public, the targets are already marked. All it will take is one breakthrough. Now here’s the real problem: Bitcoin can’t pivot. Changing its cryptographic system would require a hard fork, a messy, risky, slow process involving every miner, node, wallet, and exchange in the world. And if history has shown us anything, it’s that Bitcoin doesn’t like to change.

Meanwhile, agencies like the NSA, China’s tech ministry, and the U.S. NIST are openly working on post-quantum standards. The people building the future are getting ready. But Bitcoin? It’s stuck. Imagine waking up and $300 billion in Bitcoin has vanished. Not because of a market crash, but because it was simply taken. Instantly. No hacks. No brute force. Just quantum math.

Some projects are preparing for this future. XRP uses a different signature system (Ed25519) that’s harder for quantum computers to break and easier to upgrade if needed. Flare is modular and designed to evolve. Hedera (HBAR) is governed by a council of real companies who can act quickly and deploy updates without the chaos of community politics. Ethereum is still using the same ECDSA as Bitcoin, and with even more complexity under the hood.

But here’s where it gets bigger. We’re not just talking about faster computing. We’re talking about a total shift in what’s possible. Quantum communication, using entangled particles for instant, secure data transfer, is already being tested. Anti-gravity propulsion, long buried under black-budget secrecy, is starting to come into the public eye. Navy patents, declassified UAP footage, and whispered disclosures are surfacing. In that world, coins that take ten minutes to settle feel like horse-drawn carriages in the age of warp drives.

The next wave of infrastructure won’t just be faster. It’ll be physics-bending, frictionless, real-time, and planetary—maybe even interplanetary. We’ll need digital assets that can sync with light-speed systems. XRP, Flare, and Hedera are at least headed in that direction. Bitcoin isn’t. So while institutions, media, and ETFs keep hyping BTC as the final destination, the truth is that it’s a monument. A symbol. A closed system that can’t keep up.

When the world flips into quantum gear, the assets that were built to move, adapt, and integrate will keep running. Bitcoin will just sit there, valuable only to those who haven’t realized the vault has already been cracked. In the end, it wasn’t digital gold. It was glass.

⸻

TLDR:

Bitcoin isn’t ready for the quantum era. Once quantum computers mature, they’ll be able to reverse-engineer wallets from public transactions. There’s no fix in sight, just delay and denial. Meanwhile, assets like XRP, Flare, and Hedera are better positioned to survive in a world where quantum tech and anti-gravity systems change everything. BTC isn’t the future. It’s a fossil.

XRP,2025-05-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Everyone’s Watching Price. No One’s Watching Bitco...,"...... 

Let's use Willow (Google's state of the art quantum chip) as an example. Willow was a major milestone wrt error rates. The current generation still has 0 real-world applications like breaking encryption. There is no functionality other than proof of concept in being able to do some extremely specific tasks faster than modern computers. Many in computational mathematics do not consider RCS to even count as computations. 

Google's previous ""quantum"" processor, Sycamore, had 53 qubits (2019). Willow has 105 physical qubits. But wait - there's IBM's Condor, sitting at 1.121 physical qubits, making it the most advanced. Ok.

As an example, we will use Bitcoin - Cracking its ECC encryption requires ~1,500 logical qubits (millions of physical ones). IBM's most optimistic goals are to achieve 100.000 physical qubits by 2033. 

Cracking Bitcoin’s encryption would require millions of error-corrected qubits.The threat is multiple decades away, and Bitcoin can upgrade to quantum-resistant tech. The same applies to general security. 

Post-quantum algorithms will likely be integrated into any protocol before quantum computers pose a legitimate threat.

XRP,2025-05-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Everyone’s Watching Price. No One’s Watching Bitco...,"The reality is the entire problem could be easily fixed but would require centralized control of Bitcoin mining/transactions, which some are not a fan of. Obviously, you understand why they can't just adjust things to account for future-proof encryption as it would make all current mining operations futile and transactions would slow to a crawl.

The solution is easily resolved by a large investment from a company willing to take over all mining/transactions. This would be accomplished by working with the company currently managing the coin. Once they have developed the future-proof encryption this would need to be converted a format that can be utilized by D-Wave devices. The investor would then be able to purchase lets say 5-10 of the systems capable of handling 5000 quibits. The devices are exceptionally limited in their functionality due to being designed to perform a vary narrow set of mathematical operations, but that would be perfect.   
  
This would resolve the issue of current mining operations not being capable of processing the stronger encryption, and basically put them all out of business. Better yet the company that does this would maintain exclusive rights to handle all transactions for some number of years in order to recoup costs and make profit.

Everyone would cry about it for a little bit but it would prevent the use of Bitcoin from dwindling to nothing in the future. At least from the security perspective. 

Just in case someone is not familiar with D-Wave I am suggesting that lets say 5 devices are created which each handle 5000 quibits. This would mean they would collectively have 2\^25000 independent threads for handling the mining/transactions of Bitcoin. Honestly, don't know why this hasn't already been done. D-Wave has had a working Quantum Annealing solution for many years now.",1

For example if you could sell and achieve Financial Independence  at $80 then you might want to sell at that point and lock-in the freedom before $Trump crashes to single digits or lower. On the other hand if a rise to $80 just brings you into $1k profits then maybe take out your initial at that point and see what you can get with the remainder.

That being said… if things do crash and I'm still in I'll just hold until
The next bull run…

That's the plan at least!

XRP,2025-01-11,post,CryptoMarkets,"With all of this considered, how can you Not be Bullish???","As the title states, I want to open up a discussion. There is *a ton* of opinions flying around about what is going to happen in the near future. I have been into crypto since 2017, and consider myself someone who is “-“all in” when it comes to crypto. I don’t believe in traditional banking. I have a background in finance, and I know too much about our current financial industry to trust it. 

I have been seeing the feeds flooded lately with a lot of doom and gloom posts about the current state of the Crypto Market. A suspicious amount of posts talking about the “Cycle is ending in March-April”, or “I’ll be fully out by 2025”, whatever it may be, there is an alarming amount of FUD going on, and to an OG like me, this is just another Bullish indicator. Now let’s dig in…

***Current Political Climate***

While many of you May or may not disagree with the current Administration, we are about to enter a very “Pro-Crypto” era of government. Something that is unprecedented. We generally have a government pushing against us, not with us. This Administration has announced that they will be the “First Pro-Crypto” Administration. One that wants to build the US into a Crypto and Blockchain powerhouse. Whether you like the President or not, this is *imperative* to the future of our country, and a very Bullish indicator….

*But what does this mean?*

When the Money Printer gets turned back on, a lot of that funding will be directed towards the Crypto industry.

They have also announced that they want to start the “Bitcoin Reserve”. Potentially buying Trillions of Dollar in BTC, to attempt to offset our looming and massive National deficit. This is also absolutely imperative. We must have this so the future generations aren’t burdened with debt and poverty caused by the Dollar that we are seeing today.

Now let me be clear with you, Trump does not want to pump crypto because he “loves the tech”. This is purely a money grab. We know he has a wallet with over $7 million in ETH. His family is deeply invested as well, and has done a few rug pulls with some NFT projects and the infamous Worldcoin project. He is going to pump the market to pump his own bags, simple as that.

***Institutional Investors: A Race to Control the Supply***

I don’t really have to spell this out to you. The big dogs are here. They want the whole shop. Ask yourself an honest question; *does  the world’s largest wealth manager want to accumulate the supply of Bitcoin, because they think the price will tank?* Extremely unlikely. We are currently witnessing a race to control the Supply of Bitcoin, and it’s happening by the top 0.1% of the wealthiest in the world. As this supply continues to dwindle, the price will continue to incrementally climb for Bitcoin, and probably the market as a whole. *Our lives will end and Billionaires will still be fighting to Control the supply, let that sink in…*

With the ETH ETF, and possible SOL and XRP ETFs also in the works, clearly Wall Street has their eye on the Crypto market. I’m not a fan of ETFs, because I know that’s how Wall Street gets away with a lot of their manipulation. ETFs are potentially bad for crypto in the long run, because they are just basically creating synthetic crypto, which is no different than Stock. However, for the sake of the conversation as a whole, I think Wall Street money flooding into these projects will only help the market in the near future.

***Quantitive Easing: The Money Printer Turns Back on.***

One thing is guaranteed over the next 4 years: Trump *must* have the “Greatest Economy in US History.” With that being said, he will turn the money printer back on with Quantitive Easing. Trump printed $8 Trillion, in a 4 year period. In comparison, Obama printed $9 Trillion over 8 years amidst the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. This isn’t to bag on Trump. This is just pointing out, he loves to pump money into the economy. Mark My Words here: Trump will have spent $10 Trillion by end of 2028, pumping up the Greatest Economy in history. A lot of that money will flow into Crypto…

Based on previous performance, Bitcoin is setting up exactly like it had prior to the last 3 major Bull runs. I think what we are currently witnessing is one of the last consolidation periods before our next big Leg up. This Bull cycle could possibly extend much longer than anticipated as BTC dominance still remains over 60%, which is generally a sign that Alt Season has not officially started yet.

***TLDR: With so many Bullish indicators and positive sentiment, how can you not be extremely Bullish about the current market state??***

***EDIT: This is just a Bullish post about the Market in general. I don’t own any Bitcoin currently, full disclosure. I’m deeply invested in Alt Coins, and won’t name any projects for the sake of the conversation.***

***Please present your Best Bear Case to debate my Bull Case. I want this to be a serious conversation, but anyone has yet to bring a legit Bear Case to the conversation. Another Bullish signal…***",33

	•	Litecoin (LTC): It’s a more established coin, and with the next Bitcoin halving coming up, LTC could benefit from the general market sentiment.
	•	NEAR Protocol (NEAR): I’ve been hearing a lot of buzz about NEAR’s tech and upcoming updates that could drive price action.

XRP - $3000

XLM - $1000

Hedera HBAR - $1000

Algo - $1000

Sui - $1000

Ethena ena - $1500

WLD worldcoin - $1500

Shiba inu, pepe, doge, render, floki - $200 each

Total $11000

All of these have yielded $300+ so far due to late timings and multiple buy sell experiments.


 Can i make atleast 2X to 3X between january 20th and april peak, cashout all, buyback lower when 60 - 70% correction occurs and then sell 6X to 10X by november 2025 in final boss bull run

Do you think I can make some changes to my profile. Add or swap any coins like cardano or AVAX?

XRP,2024-07-22,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Keep or buy new coins? ...,One thing I’d recommend is to do a thorough review of whatever data/news you can and make sure the original reason you bought something is still valid.  Recently just about everything was way down coinciding with some major sales of Bitcoin holdings in the billions of dollars.  Just because they are down recently probably isn’t a good determining factor.  Chances are whatever you switch into was similarly affected.  If the original thesis that led you to buy hasn’t changed then there may not be a reason to sell.  Then again if you question the original reason you got them there might be.  I won’t recommend it one way of the other rather I’d suggest a methodological approach that is based on gathering data.  Which is in fact what you are doing here bravo.  Now one thing is if there is something you like better and they are also down with the German and Mt. Gox sell off then converting to that probably isn’t a bad idea.  I noted another user parks stuff on a ledger.  Happens that I do that too.  If you can afford to HODL it that way he’s probably right.  Examine your time horizon.  I look near term and long term.  In the long run somethings will go to zero while others are going to become institutions of sorts.  It might be worth taking a chance that XRP for instance won’t zero out.  I admit to holding a position in my Ledger as well.  Of course I bought it during the recent downturn.  I had also consolidated some positions before the market went sideways so I had USDC on hand to convert to new positions.  Such as Aerodrome.  If you go that route and want to hold into the 2030s I’d look at the long term staking there.,2

If the real bull run is expected to start at the end of the year and run into next November as many predict, the alt coins will jump with it. The coins you still have are at least not rug pulls and therefore they should take off again to some amount. Cash out then and wait a year for the market to crash (should be after next November, as per the cycle experts).

But looking at my trades, I’d have been better off if I just bought and kept it, but of course in hindsight it’s obvious because it keeps going up. If it was more volatile and going sideways for a longer period, the trading strategy would have been better.

If the pullback never came I wouldn’t add, but I already have a lot of exposure to btc in my investments. If I had minimal exposure, I’d suggest you continue to add. When you’re unsure, the easiest thing to do is do half “I usually put in $100 per week, I will instead put in $50 per week”. If you are going to wait for the bear market, write down a number you will buy it at, e.g. 40% below the ATH or $100k, and then stick to that, because I guarantee you, when shits starts falling apart you will 100% move the goal post and wait for it to go lower and then you’ll never buy.

XRP,2025-02-06,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP struggles to hold above $3...,"The bet in XRP is that it will become successful as a cross-border payment medium in the medium/long term. It's more like a Ripple stock than a real crypto asset in a way. For now, it got hit hard by the reaction to Trump tariffs which shook all alts. But when you think it was 50 cents before the Trump pump, I'd say it's actually showing remarkable resilience. Personally, I transferred 1/3 of my XRP to ETH from the fear of it going back to cents and because ETH was precisely at the pre-Trump price, so I figured it wouldn't go much lower (the right call, it seems). It's the most damaged part of my wallet, but I think the long term bet is unchanged.",2

With all this new money into bitcoin it will take a little longer for alt season imho. 

With that being said. Just hodl for another 6 months to a year. 

History does not repeat. But it will rhyme. 

We should have a nice pump any day to the next 6 months I’d think. And at least by the end of the year. 

I expect a nice pump by February March April. Then normally a dip in the summer. Then another great pump August September 

This is just how the last bull run in 21 was. And also in 17. 

Now again with the new billion dollar businesses  investing. This could slow down alt season. But it will pump. 

IT WILL PUMP. 

The way I look at XRP. 

when it pumps to $5 or $10 ok sell 50% pumps more sell another 30%

Always hodl about 10 to 20 %. Only because I believe xrp could have a promising future in the next years to a decade. Being worth $100 or $509 or $1000.

XRP,2024-10-21,post,CryptoMarkets,Some advice to newer people about this Bitcoin rise,"Hello there people,

I just wanted to remind you all about the fact that you should stay rational right now. I understand that with Bitcoin rising towards 70k, one or the other might succumb to the feeling of FOMO. And please, I'm telling you: Don't fall for your emotions. Despite what everyone on the internet or the news might be telling you currently, Bitcoin is absolutely NOT guaranteed to head higher from here. We have been in a range for the past 7 months and it's possible that we keep doing that for another few months, who knows? Don't think that Bitcoin 100% has to start going ""because we are in Q4"" or some shit.

Especially the times where everyone is screaming that Bitcoin ""is breaking out!!!"" are the ones where most people get it wrong. We could also go below 50k again and I'm asking you: Are you prepared for that?

I'm not saying we will necessarily go there (though I personally do have my reasons to believe this), but if that scenario is not on your radar, then you shouldn't be in the markets. Don't overleverage yourself, and practice caution. Don't get hyper bullish and don't FOMO in. Be prepared for both cases, up and down, we are not out of the woods yet.",27

Buy a few top, well researched alts when they’ve dropped substantially. Next solid run, sell all alts and put some back into BTC. Hold the balance. Wait again…repeat. But always hold 75%+ BTC.

Right now is the exact opposite. Bitcoin broke out of this “apparent” bull flag and people are seeing 100k.

Ues global liquidity has a part to play but then the market seemed to be doing ok before Trump launched his coin. People sold out of a lot of legitimate projects for that piece of junk.

Now we’re at the point where people cant trust his erratic decisions and policies whether to invest or not i.e. tariffs (wtf).

Crypto “bros” are scared to invest, that’s why we’re seeing a slow selloff because people are taking profits before they lose them.. 

But you’re right in the case that if there was a printing of money, there would be a bit of an uptrend.

Constant rubbish like [THIS](https://x.com/DigitalG15/status/1916779595602305469) is posted with no evidence. Just trust me bro with paint created images. 

While conveniently ignoring what SWIFT themselves shares on their website, such as; [this](https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-ubs-asset-management-and-chainlink-successfully-complete-innovative-pilot-bridge-tokenized-assets-existing-payment-systems) and [this](https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-unlocks-potential-tokenisation-successful-blockchain-experiments), which explains their ongoing blockchain experiments/trials.

I've thought about this a bit. I think it is possible. If network fees don't increase, and mining continues being centralised in the hands of a few large companies. They will have the hash rate to create a fork. I'd assume the majority of people would be forced to follow the banks/etf's,

The alternative possibility is that the large miners (who have well over 50% of the hash rate) will collude and decide it's better to fork bitcoin. Removing the hard cap. Offering more bitcoin per block mined. Making mining more feasible to sustain.

My advice is to try to think about this for the long term, and never try timing the market, just DCA in dips and accumulate as much as you can, remember as of now crypto is being used or held by only 4%-6% of people in the world, people sometimes forget about this and think they are not that early when is completely the opposite.",2

Investing in crypto is a lot like buying and selling cars. Just like there are many types of cryptocurrencies, there are many types of cars….each serving different purposes and having different value trajectories over time.

Some cryptos, like some cars, are built for the long haul. Classic and rare cars ….like vintage Ferraris or limited-edition muscle cars ….tend to hold or even increase in value over time. Similarly, some cryptocurrencies are designed with strong fundamentals and long-term potential, making them worth holding onto.

On the other hand, some cryptos are more like everyday commuter cars. They serve their purpose for a while but eventually depreciate and become obsolete. These might be better suited for trading ….buying low and selling high before they lose their value.

Then there are the bargain hunters …people who flip cars for a profit, spotting undervalued gems and making money through short-term trades. The same happens in crypto, where traders capitalize on price fluctuations. Some make a fortune this way, while others miscalculate and take a loss.

Ultimately, whether you buy, hold, or trade depends on your strategy, risk tolerance, and what lets you sleep at night. There’s no single right or wrong approach …. only what works best for you. Do your research, understand what you’re getting into, and make decisions based on your own goals, not just what others say…!

Personally I am holding amounts of Xrp and Hbar long term along with a few others.

Remember never put in more than you are prepared to lose.. make your profit take plan and stick to it.. Good Luck …!!!!!",1

different blockchains work in different ways & learning to work with them means getting to understand how each of them work differently. 

the speed of transmission of transactions on the XLM and XRP blockchains are unrivalled by slow lumbering projects like BTC — where transactions can take ten minutes versus a few seconds. 

not every address on these blockchains needs memos but those that do are often tied to a DEX where one address has many memo subaddresses — not unlike an apartment complex with a street address and apartment numbers. 

learn to use them and you will be OK. complaining about it here just shows you probably need do more due diligence in your transactions.",1

XRP,2025-02-20,post,CryptoMarkets,Shorting Solana and Why I’m doing it (Solana Fan),"EDIT: Looks like a called the ByBit Black Swan event a few days prior. I’m impressed with myself

So I’m a long term solana buyer and holder.

I’ve made great returns on it, but recently I believe I miscalculated what was going to happen after the trump pump.

I was holding on to an older way of thinking, and because I didn’t sell near the trump pump high, I was waiting to get back to those highs. I’m sure many of you are doing this rn.

However I decided to get on the sideline with SOL after the Libra scandal because my profits were sliding away fast. I’m not a hodlr, I like to time the market strategically during market trends. This has worked very well for me, with some bad calls here and there.

Given that background, I’ve been conducting a significant amount of market research on Solana and want to provide you all this information so you’re not stuck in an echo chamber 

Negative Narrative:

Solana has earned its way to the scammers paradise through meme pump and dumps

Solana already had a huge run up the last 1-2 years

FTX reimbursements are entering the market soon

LIBRA scandal (there is more to this watch the coffeezilla video) this could get a lot more ugly if what’s reported is true

Potential for exchange crash. There seems to be a huge scandal on an exchange every cycle. In this case there may be a black swan event around USDC (SOL) or JUP or another platform. (This is a stretch, but if it were gonna happen somewhere I believe it would happen on the solana network this cycle)

Other networks are viewed as more reliable or for serious business like Ethereum or Cardano

Positive Narrative:

SOL can do what it’s always done, provide a network for extremely fast and cost effective transactions 

Tax feee American cryptos

That’s about it

Price movement:

Everyone is aware how poorly SOL is doing in the last 7-30 days. It’s been hit a lot worse than the rest of the market. Even though the market is in the red, SOL is significantly lower

SOL price chart shows SOL about to dump right before the Trump Pump. One could argue we would have been at the current price sooner if not for that event.

Next lower resistance is in the 150s and then the 120s. With so much FUD, I would not be surprised that if we break through 160 that we end up at 120 in a 7 day period.

Competition:

XRP has positive narratives currently and none of the negative environment that surrounds solana

Ethereum is the first mover and 2nd largest crypto. It has a huge L2 network for low fees and has a lot of room for price growth this cycle

SUI, like solana without all the FUD

Conclusion:

Given all this information, I believe SOL will reach 120s as the new low and hold in that price area for the remainder of the alt bull run while other coins prosper. 

It may go even lower once alt season ends and we are in a true bear market.

I am a huge fan of SOL, it is my favorite crypto. However my main goal is to make money, and this is how I am seeing it.

As Thanos would say, “I’m sorry little one”

I’m shorting SOL

XRP,2024-07-28,post,CryptoMarkets,WHAT DO YOU THINK? ,"Hi everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read my post! I'm preparing for the upcoming crypto bull run and would love to get your thoughts on my portfolio lineup. Here’s what I currently have and my plans for adjustments:

# Current Holdings:

1. **Shiba Inu (SHIB)**: $34,900 at an average cost of $0.000026 (Yes, I know I’m down a lot, lol).
2. **Ethereum (ETH)**: $14,500 at an average cost of $3,531. I’m feeling a bit uncertain about this one since it’s a large investment but only 4.1 coins. I’m considering selling it when I break even (currently down over $1k). What do you think of this idea?
3. **(EXP)**: $2,600 at an average of $0.60. I want to increase my EXP holdings to $10,000.

# Planned Final Lineup:

1. **SHIB**: $35,000
2. **ETH**: $14,500 (maybe)
3. **XRP**: $10,000
4. **VeChain (VET)**: $10,000
5. **Cardano (ADA)**: $10,000
6. **Stellar (XLM)**: $10,000
7. **Hedera (HBAR)**: $10,000

I’ll have about $8,500 left to invest, or $23,000 if I decide to exit my ETH position. This would allow me to invest $10,000 in two more coins. I’m considering Bonk and Dogecoin (DOGE), but I’d love to hear your thoughts on this or any other suggestions you might have.

Ethereum is a large cap and just got their ETF approved. It is unlikely you will make a 10x from holding Eth, but ETH will likely give you a solid 2-3x in a bull market.

XRP,2025-06-18,post,CryptoMarkets,Today’s Top Crypto Stories in Under 2 Minutes,"**1) Bitcoin’s Geopolitical Whiplash**

* BTC spiked to ≈ $107 K, then reversed as missile headlines out of the Israel-Iran theater hit the tape (FXEmpire 10:35 PM).
* Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin squeeked out gains while on-chain data show \~1 million coins just aged into the ≥ 1-year HODL bucket, a classic sign of deeper conviction.

**2) Coinbase Eyes 24/7 Stock Trading — on-chain**

* The exchange formally asked the SEC to list “tokenized equities” that would trade round-the-clock on its own rails (Reuters 7:00 PM; Crypto Crib 5:00 PM).
* A green light would set up a cage-match with zero-commission brokerages like Robinhood; the stock popped on the filing before fading with the broader crypto-equity sell-off (Unusual Whales 4:58 PM, Zacks 6:46 PM).

**3) JPMorgan’s Stable-Coin Push**

* Wall Street’s biggest bank rolled out a pilot for JPMD, a deposit-backed dollar token, on Coinbase’s “Base” L2 (iNewsroom / Financial Juice 4:07 PM; Seeking Alpha 3:53 PM).
* Follow-up briefs note the token may eventually pay interest, a break from today’s stable-coins (Wallstengine 3:11 PM) and another marker that private-chain settlement is moving from proof-of-concept to table stakes (MarketFlux 3:08 PM).

**4) XRP Ledger’s XLS-80 Buzz**

* Hype around the “compliance-ready” XLS-80 upgrade has traders asking whether XRP can steal regulated-use-case share from Ethereum (Coincu 10:49 PM).
* Meme-token spin-offs like $APORK have already latched onto the narrative, pumping volumes on the ledger (same source).
* Canadian regulators just approved the first spot-XRP ETF, hinting at mainstream capital inflows that could underpin the $14 price targets making the rounds (News.Bitcoin.com 10:40 PM).

**5) Ripple-SEC Truce on the Horizon?**

* Ripple and the SEC jointly asked Judge Torres for an “indicative ruling” that might pave the way to a negotiated end-game (News.Bitcoin.com 9:40 PM; CoinGapeMedia 1:21 PM).
* The court filing briefly lifted sentiment, but XRP still fell 7 % as lawyers warned a deal isn’t baked in yet (Tokenpost 8:34 PM; NewsBTC 12:08 AM).
* At the same time, the SEC delayed decisions on new XRP ETFs (Coinpedia 9:03 PM), keeping the regulatory overhang in place.

**6) Thailand’s Five-Year Tax Holiday**

* Bangkok approved a 100 % capital-gains exemption on crypto profits through 2029, a direct play to siphon traders from Singapore and Hong Kong and cement Thailand’s claim as ASEAN’s rising crypto hub.

Let's take XRP for example. 

Convincing Congress to use tax payer money to buy an asset that is controlled by one company, that isn't mined, but created out of thin air, and one that currently has 38 Billion tokens in circulation with a maximum supply of 100 Billion, will not be easy. Also remember that Ripple labs controls their blockchain and can make changes as they see fit. Ripple has full control of XRP.

XRP,2025-03-05,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Quick question hope this don’t sound stupid lol...,"  the idea that Ripple controls XRP the way a company controls stock isn’t accurate. 

 XRP Ledger is decentralized, and Ripple is just one player in the ecosystem. They can’t unilaterally change the rules..validators across the network have to approve any changes, and Ripple doesn’t own the majority of them. 

 Unlike Bitcoin mining, which is controlled by a handful of massive mining pools (many in China), XRP’s consensus model is more energy-efficient and doesn’t have that kind of centralization risk.

Now, about the supply…yes, Ripple holds a lot of XRP in escrow, but that’s actually a good thing if you’re worried about price stability. 
 Bitcoin has a max supply of 21 million, but it’s still highly volatile because it’s completely at the mercy of speculation with no real-world backing. XRP, on the other hand, is being integrated into global financial infrastructure, with major banks and institutions using it for cross-border payments.

As for using taxpayer money…if Ripple is contributing 35% of their escrow rather than the government buying it outright, that’s a completely different scenario. 

 Instead of spending taxpayer dollars, the U.S. would be acquiring a strategic crypto reserve at no direct cost to taxpayers.

And let’s not forget, Bitcoin has already been rejected by multiple countries for reserves because it’s too volatile and lacks real utility beyond speculation. 

 Even Coinbase’s CEO called it a meme coin recently. The OG meme coin imo.  

So…if the goal is to have a stable digital asset with actual use cases for payments, settlements, and financial infrastructure, XRP makes way more sense than Bitcoin.",3
XRP,2025-03-05,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Quick question hope this don’t sound stupid lol...,"Your assuming we’re going to buy them….


Now…the big discussion is about Ripple’s escrow. They currently hold about 41.3 billion XRP in escrow, and there’s talk that they might transfer around 35% of it to the government for this reserve. 

 One of the ways they could do it is by handing over control of the escrowed funds to a government controlled account. Nothing’s confirmed yet, but it’s definitely a huge move if it happens. 

   If that happens, here’s where it gets really interesting…since the president has the authority to set the price of XRP, that means the U.S. could essentially fix its value globally, especially in relation to CBDCs and the banking system.

If they set it at the right price, it wouldn’t just boost XRP’s role in global finance…it could also be used to pay off the national debt. 

 Basically, by valuing XRP at a high enough level, the U.S. could leverage its holdings to settle massive financial obligation. It’s a wild but very real possibility.

 Lastly….If the president sets a fixed price for XRP, it would prevent other countries from manipulating its value on the open market. 

 Since the U.S. would control a significant portion through the strategic reserve, it could dictate XRP’s price relative to CBDCs and global financial systems. This would stabilize XRP’s valuation and eliminate volatility caused by external market forces or foreign manipulation.


Big MOVES ahead folks…stay tuned.",2

is not XRP, and while they are the biggest holder of XRP the escrow mechanic stops them from dumping everything on the market - there is nothing like that in place to stop BTC holders or Satoshi 

But yeah at this point seized crypto only and might be a while until congress is on board with any spending - the reserve is still a big win for crypto regardless",1
XRP,2025-03-08,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Quick question hope this don’t sound stupid lol...,"You are wrong - XRP is not controlled by Ripple - they are just the biggest holder; they only control 1 of the validators, and have had proposals rejected from being adopted across the XRPL… they control RLUSD and have a vested interest in XRP but they have no more control over it than any validator on the network. 

There is also the escrow mechanic keeping them from dumping on the market - it’s in their interest to keep trading and overall they have added a lot of value and engaged with institutions etc - there is no escrow mechanic keeping BTC whales, miners, or countries like China / Russia dumping on the market because of geopolitics though!

BTC has Satoshi who could dump 1m on the market if he wanted to… others like microstrategy are slowly taking control of more and more of the supply as well 

One reason the  reserves / digital stockpiles are being built from seized / forfeited assets is that it can be done without congress - 

There is some irony in people claiming BTC is less centralized, and can’t be taken vs other decentralized cryptos like XRP…

I would like to transform my XRP into BTC.

XRP,2025-01-31,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: How are you ACTUALLY supposed to analyze a good lo...,"A few thoughts :   
  
One important thing to realise is that When it comes to crypto, MARKET CAP IS NOT HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN PUT IN TO A PROJECT. Market cap is just the current price x the circulating supply... Supply and demand move the price up and down...  and this, in turn, changes the market cap.  If people start buying a lot, the market cap can suddenly goor billions very quickly, even if only thousands and millions are going up to millions.  The opposite is also true - if millions are coming out, billions can be knocked off market cap... The volatility is a great perk but also a risk. Stocks generally move significantly less than crypto.

XRP,2025-04-10,post,CryptoMarkets,Trade War 2.0 Just Dropped — Are We About to See a Crypto Shakeup?,"China hit the U.S. with an 84% tariff on a range of goods, and the U.S. retaliated with its own. Classic trade war vibes. But here’s the kicker — crypto markets *immediately* felt it. BTC dipped, ETH got slapped, even XRP took a nosedive.

Then Trump hits pause on the tariffs for 90 days, and boom — Bitcoin jumps back to \~$83K like nothing happened. It's wild how much macro stuff is affecting the crypto scene right now.

Some thoughts I’ve been chewing on:

* **Mining could get wrecked in the U.S.** Most mining gear comes from China (Bitmain, Canaan, etc). If tariffs go through, it’s gonna get way more expensive to mine here. Could push more operations overseas or crush smaller miners altogether.
* **BTC is acting more like a tech stock than digital gold.** Every time Wall Street catches a cold, Bitcoin sneezes. Where’s that “hedge against the system” energy?
* **Haven vibes incoming?** On the flip side, if this trade war keeps escalating and fiat currencies start feeling the heat, could we see people flock to BTC as a digital haven again?
* **Stablecoin squeeze?** With rising tensions, is there a world where the U.S. or China starts cracking down harder on USD-backed stablecoins?

Anyway, this feels like one of those ""we’ll look back on this in hindsight"" moments. Curious what the rest of y’all think — is crypto still too tied to global markets? Or is this all just noise before the next leg up?",15

XRP,2024-11-28,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Exit strategies...,"Exit strategy: sell higher than when you bought it.

I only hold ADA from your list and I'd say testing the previous ATH is a very conservative target, but its also what lots of people are actually waiting for. There are lot of people that started getting into crypto last bull run, so they bought near the ATH and have been in red for a while, so the moment it get retested youre gonna have a group of people putting their sell orders to recover and another group actually taking profits, so it will go down after that and it will probably take a few weeks to consolidate. Thats a good moment to take any profit Id say and if you are lucky you might grab the top.

I'd personally think ADA has more potential due to the recent Trump pump and the fact that there are some rumours regarding Trump, Elon and Charles working together so i believe ADA will go past the ATH this bull run after Trumps inauguration, so I'd keep DCAing but will take 50% profits at $3 and use it to buy the correction that will come after and keep riding the bull run taking profits at $4 and at $5 altough Id probably be super surprised and scared if ADA reaches $5 so i think that would be my target to fully exit. Of course there will be a big correction if that ever happens so theres always a chance to go back in. 

This is just my opinion though and I reckon is not the most optimistic (still 3x from current price). Butr if you're looking for opium and hype, go to the CryptoCurrency subredit and you'll find a bunch of people claiming cardano has potential for $10 or even more in this run. Idk where they pull those numbers from tho

TLDR: conservative target for ADA: $3 and take half the profits and buy the correction. Optimistic target for ADA: $5 and fully exit trying hard not to gamble all the profits to buy the correction hoping for some parabolic shit that would make me rich haha",1

XRP,2025-02-14,post,CryptoMarkets,XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality,"
The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale and NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF. The countdown to the approval of several spot XRP ETFs has begun.
The SEC has just given a green light to Grayscale’s proposal for a Spot XRP ETF by officially acknowledging the 19b-4 filing submitted via NYSE Arca—and now they’re calling on the public for feedback. In the filing posted last Thursday, the commission set a 21-day deadline for comments after the notice hits the Federal Register. Once that window closes, the SEC will decide whether to give this ETF the thumbs-up, knock it back, or even open up formal proceedings.

This 19b-4 filing is a crucial second step in launching a spot XRP ETF. Once it’s published in the Federal Register, the regulatory process really kicks into gear.

Recently, a slew of crypto ETFs—from Solana to Dogecoin—have been on the SEC’s radar as firms test the waters for regulatory approval.

The Crypto Thaw
This shift comes as the SEC appears to be easing up on its crypto stance following former Chair Gary Gensler’s departure last month. Gensler was famously skeptical, often labeling most cryptocurrencies as securities. In contrast, the agency has already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and later, spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a more welcoming environment for digital assets.

Asset managers including WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have each submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF would allow investors to gain direct exposure to XRP without the hassle of holding the coin. This isn’t just a clever piece of financial engineering—it’s a potential game-changer that bridges the gap between traditional Wall Street and the fast-moving crypto frontier.

These filings are more than just regulatory checkboxes; they’re statements of intent. The idea is to democratize access to XRP, inviting both retail investors and institutional titans to partake in what many see as the next big chapter in crypto history.

Today the SEC acknowledged Grayscale and the NYSE’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF.  It’s the bullish XRP news that Ripple watchers have been waiting for.

XRP ETFs are close to approval wrote Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X

Green Light Soon?
The SEC’s nod to the XRP 19b-4 filings isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox—it’s a pivotal move in the ETF approval saga. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it clearly shows that the wheels are turning. If, and when an XRP ETF does eventually get the green light, we could be staring down the barrel of a major institutional investment wave, one that’s likely to boost liquidity and demand significantly.

With regulatory clarity inching closer and Ripple making bold strides on the global stage, we have to ask: Are we on the verge of witnessing XRP’s metamorphosis from a mere utility asset into a bona fide mainstream financial instrument? If so, this isn’t just evolution—it’s a revolution that could upend traditional investment paradigms. XRP to the moon.

A Shifting Regulatory Landscape
With pro-crypto President Trump in charge, and new SEC chair Paul Atkins at the helm—whose track record hints at a more open-minded approach to digital assets—the stage is set for XRP ETF applications to clear the regulatory hurdle.

This potential pivot isn’t just about XRP—it’s emblematic of a broader transformation in how regulators might handle digital assets. For contrarians like us, it’s a fascinating development. While some fear that regulatory embrace could water down the decentralized ethos of crypto, others see it as the inevitable maturation of a market that’s been too raw for too long.

Market Impact: Bulls Charging, Bears on Alert
The ripple effects of these ETF applications could be huge. Analysts are already speculating that if approved, these ETFs could inject between $4 billion and $8 billion in net new assets into the XRP ecosystem within the first year. That’s not chump change—it’s a tidal wave of capital that could drive XRP’s price and liquidity to new heights. That means XRP price predictions for 2025 will have to be adjusted higher. As you can see on the XRP price chart below, the XRP price moved 4% higher on today’s news.

XRP,2025-02-14,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality...,"XRP and Stable Coins

I just posted this on my other account but here goes nothing haha. 

Xrp (I can’t post on there not enough Karma) please read.

Q:So why XRP will do well? 

A (My theory): USA is moving towards stable coins. We have printed to much cash and don’t have anything to back it up. We want to move back to gold, assets, and essentially bitcoin. The way we do that is make stable coins. These stablecoins can be backed by real-world assets (such as USD, EUR, or commodities) and traded on the decentralized exchange (DEX) within the XRPL. Also they are backed by USA treasury bonds. XRP is the bridge. XRPL supports the issuance of stablecoins and other digital assets through its built-in Issued Currencies (previously known as lOUs). This allows financial institutions, businesses, or even individuals to issue stablecoins on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution uses XRP to facilitate instant cross-border payments. In cases where stablecoins are used for settlements, XRP can still serve as a bridge asset to enhance liquidity and enable efficient transfers between different fiat and stablecoin corridors. The XRP Ledger has a built-in DEX, where users can trade stablecoins against XRP and other assets. This allows for fast and low-cost conversion between stablecoins and XRP. 

EX: Imagine a financial institution issues a USD-backed stablecoin on the XRPL. A user in Europe wants to convert that USD stablecoin into a Euro-backed stablecoin.
Instead of finding direct liquidity between USD-stablecoin and EUR-stablecoin, XRP can act as an intermediary, making the transaction faster and cheaper.",2

XRP,2025-02-14,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality...,"Why would you use XRP instead of a stable coin? Crazy to utilise a asset with a changing price to swap value. And then do it on a network that has downtime. 

Infact, why would you even need to perform a swap? Most decent bridge protocols allow you send the value (e.g EUR) with a message and will perform the swap as part of its function and the purchase of whatever you are swapping for, on existing DEX's or existing pools with no slippage . 

The tech has moved on .

Edit: here is an example of what I am talking about. 

Bank using a private chain, initiated a purchase on a public chain buying a tokenised carbon credit in one transaction with a stable coin and sent it back to the private chain.

XRP,2025-03-23,post,CryptoMarkets,XRP 2018 All Time Highs,"I really like the XRP project and what Ripple has done with the lawsuit. I've been watching everything since 2020 and invested and accumulated at an average price of $0.50. So I'm pretty happy with that. But something I just realized today is that I cannot believe XRP was ever $3.30 back in 2018. It seems that a long time has passed, we have more fundamentals and good news than ever, and we still are below all time highs? Even with all the new liquidity that came into the crypto space over the years. I entered the crypto markets back in 2017 and I remember then it still being a really taboo subject. People from my job back then called me crazy. But how in the world was [XRP $3.30](https://my.palisadefinance.com/assets/C412612) back then?

XRP,2025-03-23,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP 2018 All Time Highs...,I’m not that fussed about xrp but a lot of projects aren’t even near all time highs probably because there’s lack of global liquidity (until very recently).

Over those years, I've seen the price of Bitcoin plummet, and soar, I don't know how many times.

Each time, those who don't understand why Bitcoin exists panic.

They lose faith in the Bitcoin revolution because they haven't bought for the right reasons, or because they haven't studied Bitcoin enough to develop the strength of conviction needed in this unique revolution.

There's nothing extraordinary about seeing the price of Bitcoin fall from $109K to $77K. It's entirely logical and to be expected.

The price of Bitcoin could fall even further. It won't change my view of Bitcoin as long as the fundamentals of the Bitcoin revolution are still there. And they are still there.

With Bitcoin, the price is different right now, but [**the guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol are the same**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/the-10-incredible-guarantees-the):

* There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
* 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
* An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
* A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
* A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
* Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
* A permanently available network (Uptime > 99.989% since Bitcoin creation)
* A never-hacked network
* The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable

XRP,2025-03-14,comment,CryptoMarkets,"Comment on: Bitcoin right now: Different price, Same guarantee...","It’s funny how btc maxis keep repeating the same talking points without ever answering the most important question:..

What does Bitcoin actually offer besides speculation?… what? 

Sure, the supply is capped at 21 million. So what? Scarcity alone doesn’t create value…utility does. 

 You talk about Bitcoin’s security and uptime, but none of that changes the fact that it’s extremely slow, extremely expensive, and completely useless in a world shifting to real utility-driven assets. 

 Bitcoin’s proof of work mining isn’t a feature…it’s a huge flaw. Each Bitcoin transaction consumes around 1,200 kWh of electricity, which is more than an average U.S. household uses in over a month. A month! …And for what? To transfer digital nothingness at a snail’s pace with massive fees? Let’s be honest. Most don’t have a clue how much electricity btc wastes. 

Even Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, labeled Bitcoin a meme coin. That wasn’t a slip-up…it was an admission that Bitcoin is nothing more than a storefront for speculation. That’s it. 

 That’s why it was isolated in its own reserve, separate from real utility tokens. 

 The world is moving toward ISO 20022-compliant tokens…the ones that actually solve financial problems. 

For example…XRP, there’s a reason it’s know as the “Banker’s token” around the world for many years.  maxis despise that. 

 Meanwhile, Bitcoin is like a flip phone in a world that’s already moved on to smartphones. Don’t get me wrong, It will always have its title as the OG meme coin, but other than that…it literally offers the world nothing. 

So again, what does Bitcoin actually offer? Besides high fees, energy waste, and a community that’s still coping with the fact that their digital rock has no purpose? 

I’ll never understand the hate/envy/jealousy btc maxis have towards real world Utility tokens, especially ISO20022 compliant tokens.",5

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All this drama between BTX and XRP has really taken off lately and it got me thinking about the pros and cons of each coin. I own both BTC and XRP (#1 & #2 of my largest holdings) so I own both dogs in the fight. Personally, I find the bickering extremely childish and off-putting and I'd rather the 2 communities just get along.

That being said, I thought the best place to explore the pros and cons of BTC would be the BTC subreddit. I’d say I have a greater-than-average understanding of how BTC works, but I’m genuinely concerned about its long-term potential. Its main use case seems to be just as a store of value, and **I’m struggling with the logical fallacy of being invested in a crypto that’s a store of value simply for the sake of being one.**

I want to believe there’s more to it, but I’m having a hard time connecting the dots and seeing the bigger picture. I know this might ruffle some feathers, but I’m honestly just looking for clarity. I really hope someone can restore my confidence in BTC because I’m seriously considering selling it. Thanks in advance to those genuinely trying to help.",2
XRP,2025-01-26,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Genuine Bitcoin Question (Attempt #4)...,"I didn't remove this question to give you some clarity.

XRP is a Scam Coin. It's a category of its own, even worse than a Sh\*tcoin like $TRUMP.

$TRUMP claims to be useless on its website.

XRP wants to make people believe that it is useful.

The flaws are major. Take for example the fact that the first 32,000 entries of the ledger are gone forever!

Then take the fact that between 50 and 60% of all tokens are in the hands of the founders and the Ripple Labs company. This was a totally unfair pre-mine distribution.

XRP is a totally centralized system as well.

Ripple Labs executives are lobbying hard to fight against Bitcoin.

This is not new and it continues today as Ripple Labs does everything to ensure that a Bitcoin reserve strategy is not created and that Trump opts instead for a Crypto Made In USA reserve strategy that would give pride of place to XRP ...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57v1S02oX6k

Part of the scam involves them putting out press releases that major banks are adopting it when all they did is bribe an employee of a bank so they could make up the lie that such a bank is involved when this is extremely misleading.

Use some common sense, Banks and governments do not need to buy into the bags of ripple investors. If there was any benefit to ripple's code (there isn't) than they could simply copy it for free as its open source.

FYI- I personally was testing the first iteration of ripple even before bitcoin was created with Ryan , so I am very familiar with ripples history and how it has been redesigned.

Here is a great recent post from greg on the matter :

Even before Bitcoin there was an idea for a digital payments system called ripple. The idea was that you could make payments via IOUs across friends networks. Like if you trust Bob to owe you up to $100 and Bob trusts Alice to owe him up to $500 and Alice trusts Chad to owe her up to $200 dollars then your computers, with knowledge of this trust network, could let Chad pay you $100 even though you don't trust him and don't even know Alice at all... by rippling the debt from party to party.

A thing about this idea was that it was completely currency agnostic, it didn't need it's own token and could be used with many simultaneously. But most critically, there is no centralized consensus needed in it, just peer to peer relationships in the form of pair-wise trust, no authorities, etc. But it was hard to get actually started due to the fact that existing money wasn't natively digital except via banks that tend to screw things up. So there wasn't a way to automatically settle these debts so usage would be really burdensome to the users.

After Bitcoin came out a lot of people were very exited for the potential to use this ripple idea with Bitcoin as a way of lowering transaction costs, lowering transaction latency, and generally improving scalability and there was a lot of discussion about that-- since it seemed that bitcoin solved the main problems that stopped ripples' usefulness and ripple addressed some interesting limitations of Bitcoin.

In any case, while this was going on the first big wave of altcoins were happening. And some prospective altcoin developers purchased the ripple name from the original ripple developer.

The system they created had none of the properties that made the original system interesting to Bitcoiners. It introduced a new currency, with a more or less unprecedentedly large hundred billion coin premine and no further mining. Rather than the strongly decentralized consensus-less design it had a consensus system, and a particularly centralized ""authorized signers"" one (though in their communication they mislead and dissembled about the level of centralization-- resulting in some ""WTF"" posts). It wasn't even particularly interesting as digital currency due to being highly centralized, but in the following years everything ""crypto"" became interesting to people looking to make a quick buck and ripple was very active in paying companies to ""partner"" with them then announcing it as if it were some genuine evidence of adoption that would drive the value of their tokens. Wave after wave of gullible members of the public bought in to these deceptive marketing pumps only to lose out as ripple and their 'partners' dumped on them.

By the nature of being massively premined this new 'ripple', which again was functionally unrelated to the original thing whose goodwill they were exploiting, started paying people to promote it-- soon bitcoin conferences and meetups were overrun with ripple promoters to the point of being annoying. They bribed exchanges for listing which huge amounts of money and coins, setting a standard that prevented altcoins that weren't massively premined from being listed and contributing to exchanges letting their less directly profitable bitcoin support rot. Then they started lobbing governments and NGOs to block or shut down Bitcoin. So you can imagine that they have few friends here.

Personally, I don't see anything wrong with people making significantly centralized transaction systems but advertising them as something they're not is unethical and lobbying to shut down alternatives that actually deliver on decentralization, particularly Bitcoin since it originated the marketplace of exuberant buyers who would buy into their coin in the first place is just outright evil.

In any case, the ideas that early on people thought of as ripple live on today-- in the form of lightning, which combined Satoshi's payment channels to harden up the security so that your channel partners don't have to be highly trusted by you. The downside of that change is that actually collateralized channels scale less poorly than IOUs, but the added security is probably well worth it.

You bring up some interesting points regarding XRP's shortfalls and I do want to come back to that, however my primary concern (BTC's future) still hasn't been answered. I wish this post was open to the larger public so that we can all have a chance to hear an even wider array of ideas but unfortunately there are other people who obviously don't want that to happen.

**TOPIC 1: BTC 's use for transactions**

I understand that you are able to use BTC to actually buy things but that's not unique to Bitcoin. XRP can be spent at thousands of vendors around the world right now as well. You can literally pay for anything from super yachts to porn. Link below.

Link: [https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xrp/](https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xrp/)

I respect Bitcoin for being the OG and for trailblazing a space for the rest of crypto to thrive but the tech just seems outdated.

For example:

*XRP transaction*: **Speed** is **2-5 seconds**, and **costs** a fraction of a **penny** (0.00001 XRP)

*BTC Transaction*: According to google, the average BTC transaction **speed** is 10 mins - 15 hours (**lets call it 10 minutes**) and **costs** I've seen anywhere from $1 - $50 depending on the size. (**To be generous lets call it $1**)

*I believe BTC fees are a percentage base so large transactions (Billions of dollars) can suffer a fee of millions of dollars. Please correct me if I'm wrong though.*

*Additionally, my understanding is when the BTC ledger is busy, the fees go up even more.*

Now why would I ever want to use BTC for a transaction when there are other options which benefits me.

**To me saying that BTC has a use case in transactions, I don't agree because the competition beats them out in every metric possible.**

 

**TOPIC 2: BTC's use as a ""Store of Value""**

**As a result of this shortcoming, the past few years BTC has rebranded itself as ""digital gold"". This moniker implies that BTC doesn't need to compete in transactions because its real use case is as a 'store of value'.**

I already addressed this . Bitcoin has orders of magnitude more users and merchant acceptance . Additionally , since ripple is so centralized it is pointless to use and I may as well use fiat instead 

>According to google, the average BTC transaction speed is 10 mins - 15 hours (lets call it 10 minutes) and costs I've seen anywhere from $1 - $50 depending on the size. (To be generous lets call it $1)

This is inaccurate information. When i spend bitcoin I pay a fraction of a penny and get an instant and private confirmation 

>the past few years BTC has rebranded itself as ""digital gold"". 

Bitcoin is not centralized like ripple so has no companies marketing team thats branding it . Bitcoin to me and millions of others is primarily money to be used. 

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is going through the normal stages of becoming a currency.

Collectible>Asset/commodity>volatile currency>Stable unit of account currency

Right now Bitcoin is between stage 2 and 3.",1

*Just because something has more users, it doesn't mean its the best method. Before cars were invented, everyone rode places on horses. Before cellphones, everyone used landlines. Credit Card payments currently dwarf Bitcoin payments, so with that logic we may as well stay with plastic.*

\>This is inaccurate information. When i spend bitcoin I pay a fraction of a penny and get an instant and private confirmation

*This is only possible via the lightning network which has a myriad of problems. This is expected when you try to retrofit new layer 2 tech on old tech which is akin to trying to retrofit a car from the 1920s to keep up with a Lambo. It makes more sense to just use a Lambo. Some issues mentioned are: Higher than promised Fees, Slower than promised transactions, High rate of failure, Increased decentalization, Decreased ease of use, The recipient needs to create an invoice to receive transactions, Frequent errors.*

*Below are some links to posts describing these issues that were posted by actual experienced Bitcoiners. There are also a bunch of reddit posts that I'm having issues linking but you can find them on the lightning network and bitcoin subreddits.*

***Many of these issues are apparently potentially impossible to fix***

**This video explains it best:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cq0C0SpbkY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cq0C0SpbkY)

[https://www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoin-lightning-network-problems/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoin-lightning-network-problems/)

***All these issues lead me to the conclusion that Bitcoin is not the best cryptocurrency or method to be used for payments.***

***Do you agree? If so why? If not, which method do you see as a better vehicle for transactions?***",1

XRP,2024-12-22,post,CryptoMarkets,What is the point of the XLM coin?,"I originally posted this in the stellar forum and im already getting attacked lol, so I think it would be more fitting to post here instead for more unbiased responses:

I’ve been in the crypto space for a long time and always looked at stellar, and pondered on its place in the crypto market. So my question is…. What is its purpose? Specifically, the XLM coin?

I haven’t really been able to find out which niche it would fill? We already have plenty of smart contract platforms, and people can use many different types of crypto for cross border payments, or even things like cashapp and online western union which are instant.

For XRP, it makes a bit more sense, because the current swift system is archaic and needs an overall, but for xlm, it’s not doing anything novel or adding anything new.

I know most of crypto prices are about speculation, but at some point, utility will drive the market.… so what utility does XLM actually have that doesn’t exist already? If you are planning to hold longterm, why?",0
XRP,2024-12-22,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: What is the point of the XLM coin?...,"From Coinmarketcap:

>Stellar (XLM) is a peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) decentralized network created in 2014 by The Stellar Development Foundation or Stellar.org. The network officially launched in 2015 with the purpose of connecting the world's financial systems and ensuring a protocol for payment providers and financial institutions. The platform is designed to move financial resources swiftly and reliably at minimal cost. Stellar links people, banks, payment processors and allows users to create, send and trade multiple types of crypto.

>The basis of the network is its native digital currency - XLM or Lumens. XLM acts as an intermediate currency for operations and is also used to pay transaction fees. How it works: the protocol converts money in a few seconds, first into XLM, and then into the requested currency.

>The Stellar payment protocol is based on distributed ledger technology -- an open-source development, community-owned and distributed by community. The crypto asset of the Stellar platform helps with cross-border transactions, overcoming the problems of high fees and slow procedures. XLM is more focused on assisting individuals transfer money than they are with institutions. Thus, Stellar offers access to financial systems, and people can send money at low cost and promptly around the world.

XRP is also investing into technology but its technology that improving on a current infrastructure with the banking system we already have. But you’re hopjng this tech is actually going to be used on a worldwide scale by all. 

DOGE.. well it’s a meme coin. You’re investing on pure hype, there really is no fundamentals to it. Elon has been a huge ambassador of it, just because he likes it!

Business can use it as well.  Check IBM to see some samples.

So you hold it if you speculate there will be demand for it.   They also can be a store of value.  I trust continued demand for actual utility more than I trust we'll all agree in the real estate story.  Btw, that wasn't the original story :)",1

We are not there yet, and most people don't even know about these stages let alone where we're at.

Some alt coins have good utility. Because they're the early pioneers, they have the potential to get a head start and establish themselves sort of like Google and Amazon did back in the day. The same arguments made against the internet are the same arguments being made about crypto. It's a scam, for criminals, etc.

I got drawn by the bull hype, I randomly put a few hundred bucks on XRP because it seemed good to me after reading 15 min worth of crypto 101 articles, thinking I was dumb af to buy just after it went x2. But it actually went x2 again since then.  
I got a bit into the euphoria and put another few hundred bucks on ETH, LINK and DOGE respectively. LINK is already up 10% why 2 others are break even for now. I know it's highly volatile and the value can be halved as easily as it can be doubled and I saw most of people advising to take gains whenever possible. But admitting I know that I won't need the money anytime soon (unless I suddenly find a costly personal project worth investing in) can I just keep putting some money into diversified cryptos here and there whenever I can afford it and ignore the up and downs for a few years or is it a sure way to lose my money ?  
I know DOGE is a memecoin and I won't put more into it, it was just for the lulz, but except that I was thinking about consolidating my positions into ETH LINK and XRP and then grab 4-5 others on the way after I'll have found more information to make a decision with at least a little more knowledge  
I'm a bit sketchy about BTC right now as I don't light the Ponzi scheme MCST is building around it right now so I probably won't buy until before a dip.

This happened during the Trump coin craze. From what I read the Solana network was experiencing congestion due to the Trump coin trading. Coinbase also came out and said they were having a problem on their end that they were working on. This made me start thinking about blockchains being used to settle banking transactions. How do we know the XRP ledger or any other blockchain can actually handle the volume of global banking transactions. We have never done it and will we only find out after its really fully in place? Im an XRP investor and all for its use, but this recent incident made me think about this? Im also no tech expert at all and just looking for others opinions and perspectives on this. ",0
XRP,2025-01-25,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Has anyone thought what could happen if XRP is use...,"As someone who does risk analysis for banking.  My RTD notation,  feel free to skip ahead to the reason to decline. 

CHARACTER :

All of xrp's eggs in a single basket, that it was never promised in the first place. People are just assuming because it ""can do"" it will. But there are many others that  ""can do"" these days

And some like hbar are gaining much more traction 

..

Wreckless leadership deserved the lawsuit they landed in.

The leadership knew of a potential issue with the presale, requested legal clarity, which is an admission of knowledge of an issue. 

Then, when clairty did not move as fast enough for their liking, they  pushed forward anyway. Landings themselves in the lawsuit to then ""be the legal clairty.""

...

CAPACITY:

Also, costs are lower but variable, which means you can never count on any overhead projection, and when processing billions of transactions, the spread adds up. 

Networks like hbar have fixed predictable rates. 

..

In addition, xrp never reaches absolute finaility, which in banking is an absolute deal killer. Tokens like hbar reach absolute finaility in 2-3 seconds.

Frankly, I am surprised more people do not talk about that last one. Because it means the xrp governance(ripple) can only ever be used for  council and never actually used as a token in banking(xrp itself)

Which circles back to the eggs in one basket they were never promised. They can not actually do what they are ""banking"" on without addressing massive technical issues, which are not even being looked into, and would most likely require a hard fork and creation of an entirely new token to fix. As it stands XRP cannot be used. 

Where as tokens like hbar would work from the start, without issues (I assume those reasons are why hbar has gathered so much traction, with enterprises)

REASON TO DECLINE: 

Layered risk, adding weckless behavior to assumed utility.

In conjunction with major technical flaws, that cause a direct conflict to their assumed income source.

Ripple is not morally or ethically fit for the use case and it is a very bad choice for the community. 

Concerns with XRP:

- Ripple’s Escrow Control
- Pre-Mined Tokens
- Ripple’s Role in Ecosystem
- Validator Influence
- Regulatory Scrutiny
- Institutional Partnerships
- Market Manipulation Risks
- Lack of Decentralized Governance
- Ripple’s For-Profit Nature

Additional info:

Ripple Labs controls a massive chunk of XRP outside of what’s already circulating around 42.4 billion XRP is locked in escrow accounts, while only approximately 57.56 billion XRP is currently in circulation.

The company releases up to 1 billion XRP per month from escrow, but they decide how much actually hits the market, with the unused portion going right back into escrow. This is a red flag for investors because it gives Ripple enormous power over XRP’s supply and, by extension, its price.

This level of centralized control means Ripple can essentially manipulate the market by releasing large amounts of XRP when prices are high to cash in or holding back supply to prop up prices when the market is down.

For a cryptocurrency that’s supposed to be decentralized, Ripple’s ability to influence supply and demand this much is a big risk for anyone investing in XRP. It raises serious questions about transparency and whether the market is being manipulated for profit.

There have been many instances of this over the years. Too many to count. Heck, we are seeing it now. Ripple is not our friend.

I’m also glad an executive order has been signed to ban CBDC’s in the US. Go figure that Ripple was very much for CBDC.",1

Absolute finality:

I can not take the risk of doing a multi-million dollar transaction and months later, having it undone because the network had decided those blocks were no good. 

Fair ordering: 

corperations pay billions to have their buildings placed even feet closer to exchanges because of the difference the milliseconds it takes for their is to send the light to them gives them enough edge to overtake and manipulate the market, without fair order its chaos. 

Variable fees: 

Even if costs are low. if they are not predictable, low means nothing. The spread at billions of transactions, even at a fraction of a cent difference, makes a difference of millions of dollars.

XRP,2024-12-09,post,CryptoMarkets,XRP is more like a stock than a crypto- Dispute or Agree?,"Disclaimer: I’m as much of a moron as the rest of you and there’s a reasonable chance that I’m 100% wrong about all of this. You have been warned. 

To me crypto in general behaves almost the exact opposite of how a stock would. Stocks fundamentally fluctuate long term based on the value of the supporting company and short term based on predictions of how that companies value might change. Crypto on the other hand fluctuates long term based on little more than hope and despair. There’s no actual today value to any of it. We have invested in bitcoin because we hope it will keep going up. We will sell it when we despair and think it will go down. No relation to any measurable value because the only actual value is, its value. In other words with stocks the value sets the market, and in crypto the market sets the value if that makes sense. (Yes I understand and agree that bitcoin in particulars use in treasuries equates to tangible value but we’re not there yet). I look at most long term crypto plays as educated wishing on a star. We all pick favorites to convince ourselves we’re making the right call but there’s no tangible value or data to back any of it up. It’s just buying with hope and selling when in despair. 

XRP fundamentally does have actual intrinsic value.  You really can’t think of it in terms of pumping based on hype like a normal crypto, you have to think of it more like you would a stock where the main question is- based on the product, the vision, and the steps being taken to achieve that vision is it over or undervalued?

Right now in my opinion it’s pretty damn difficult to make a case that it’s overvalued. In fact if your opinion is that it’s overvalued I would actually love to hear why you feel that way. 

When I see XRP I see a company (not a crypto) that has had its prices artificially held down by a pretty scary lawsuit for several years with some pretty exciting stuff both on the horizon and actually in use today. To me is not dissimilar to Nvidia when we first started hearing about Blackwell and seeing them start to take over the AI space. Nvidia at the time was the leader in AI GPU’s with a potential future of absolutely exploding. Ripple has a very solid system that’s being implemented by some of the largest banks in the world (value today), with things like mass financial institution adoption, stable coin, treasury assets etc on the very near horizon. When I look at XRP I see an actual plan with a vision and goal in mind developing quickly right in front of me. To me, that is a company, not a crypto. So again the question, if we can all agree that it’s been artificially undervalued from the lawsuit, is what is the actual value of the underlying asset? Once the hype dies down and the price evens out to match its actual value, what should it trade for?",0
XRP,2024-12-09,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: XRP is more like a stock than a crypto- Dispute or...,"It’s price wasn’t artificially held down. It was under SEC investigation and that was priced in at the time. It was always either going to go to zero or get past the lawsuit.

If a ""stroop"" (a term for the smallest unit of Stellar Lumens, where 1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops) runs on lumens, then the most similar concept in the XRP ecosystem would be the ""drop,"" where 1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops. 

Just like stroops are used as the smallest accounting unit on the Stellar network for transaction fees and other purposes, drops serve a similar function on the XRP Ledger. They are used to denominate the smallest possible unit for transaction fees, ensuring precision in accounting and transactions. 

Therefore, drops run on XRP similarly to how stroops run on lumens.


Now,  imagine 1 xrp token is worth Xxxxxxxxxxx
A drop is worth, say Xxxxxxx

Do the math. 
- So XLM goes to a big number ok

- imagine $250 per XLM

- if someone got paid working at the Gym $1000 a week, you would get paid 4 XLM a week.

- But wait, you are seeing Non Native XLM now. Is it is something else? The answer is yes. It is a fractionalised version. And it has a name. 

For XLM a Stroop.
For XRP a Drop.
For XDC a Wie",1

XRP,2024-12-17,comment,CryptoMarkets,Comment on: Doing research. Does market cap matter or not? Dep...,"Market cap matters when trading or investing in crypto. It's a key indicator of a project's overall value and potential.

Think of market cap as the total value of all the coins or tokens in circulation. A higher market cap generally means a project is more established and has greater liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell without causing drastic price swings.

For example, if you had $1,000 worth of tokens in a project with a $10 million market cap, and the market cap increased to $100 million, your tokens would be worth $10,000 (assuming the supply remained constant).

With smaller market caps, moving the price significantly takes less capital inflow. This can lead to higher volatility and greater potential for both gains and losses. Larger market cap projects tend to be more stable but might also have less growth potential.",2

*My Coingecko Portfolio tracker has crashed twice tonight from site overload.*   
*The Crypto market is down 7.5%*  
*The blood is starting to flow.*

The way to approach this bear market, and plan ahead is to set limit orders, dollar cost average, and wait for the recovery. You should be prepared to leave your money in the market for **four years** in a worst case.

To outperform global index trackers and stock indices you only need to make *10%* per year, if you get *40%* profit in the worst case projection of *four years*, you'll have roughly hit that goal.   
You'll have done even better if you make good use of staking rewards.

If you buy ETH at $1600 and sell at $2300 you'll easily hit this goal. **That's a rather conservative target!**

Shorting the market can be risky for new traders and often requires understanding safe leverage, it may also go badly if there's a random good news event (eg Trump tweets all tariffs are gone lmao).   
If in doubt, take long positions only.

My own positions:  
I brought Sol at $110, Dot at $3.95 and ETH at $1600.  
I have an additional, larger, limit order set on ETH at $1300.   
Depending how long this market continues, I'll be regularly buying ETH at any level below $1600, and keeping a close eye on SOL.

If you don't know what to buy it's hard to go wrong with BTC or ETH.   
If you want smaller caps I'd stick within the top 25 cryptos and avoid any meme coins, no one is buying memecoins when they're worried about recession... no one smart anyway.",4

The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings with Bitcoin is not recommended at this point. Bitcoin should be seen like a high risk asset, and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin. If you receive payments with Bitcoin, many service providers can convert them to your local currency.

4. **China's Crypto Circus:** Despite a crackdown, China's still a big player. From blockchain projects to underground mining, they're in the game. Trump's tariffs are shaking things up even more.
5. **Regulation Roulette:** The US is trying to be crypto-friendly, but the lack of clear rules keeps things spicy. Will we ever get some solid regulations?
